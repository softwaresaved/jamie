The energy surface corresponding to these interactions can be calculated from first-principles, in theory allowing physical properties to be derived ab-initio from a molecular simulation; that is by theory alone and without the need for any experiments. Recently we have focussed on applying these techniques to model carbon dioxide properties, such as density and phase separation, for applications in Carbon Capture and Storage. However, there is enormous potential to exploit this approach in a huge range of applications. A significant barrier is the computational cost of calculating the energy surface quickly and repeatedly, as a simulation requires. In collaboration with the School of Chemistry we have recently developed a machine-learning technique that, by using a small number of precomputed ab-initio calculations as training data, can efficiently calculate the entire energy surface. This project will involve extending the approach to more complicated molecules and testing its ability to predict macroscopic physical properties. \n",

      " The advent of the ‘Big Data’ agenda over the last five years has opened a new set of technical challenges and opportunities for transport studies. These relate to the potential availability of significantly enhanced quality, coverage and level of detail in data concerning the movement of goods and people. This is already proving a ‘game changer’ for the transport sector in terms of understanding travel demand and whole-journey characteristics by mode, population segment, time of day and route. So called ‘User Generated Content (UGC)’ related to transport, mobility and demand for access to goods and services is now generated from static sensors, pervasive devices, transactional records and unstructured textual data. A set of associated Big Data from transport related sectors including education, entertainment, retail, health, finance and security have also emerged. This new data allows new approaches to answering some of the grand challenges for the transport and related sectors: reducing congestion, reducing the carbon-energy burden from the transport sector, improving accessibility, human led policy design, improving long term city planning and sector integration, developing mobility strategies for tackling new challenges such as disease/epidemic dispersion, food security, better management of key transport related infrastructure and assets for all modes, and enhanced security, safety and travel experience. The associated challenges include the need for improved methods to efficiently store, visualise, process and analyse high volume transport UGC, ontological development, data fusion and the production of actionable information for secondary analysis, leading to short and long term decision support. \n",

The host department is ACCIS. \n",
      " The aim of the project is to take the first step towards designing and creating engineering structures with ontogenetic adaptation as observed in living bone; structures which adapt in response to external loading to overcome design uncertainties. Taking this first step requires an improved understanding of (1) how complex forms of organized matter emerge within the body, and (2) how these materials and structures assemble and remodel in response to stimuli (i.e. mechanical stress) over the life course.  You will have a PhD in materials science/mechanical engineering. Experience of physical or mechanical testing of materials and finite element modelling is essential. Interest or experience in bioengineering, healthcare engineering, or bone biology is an advantage.  In this investigation, the work is primarily experimental with supporting computational components. The specific objectives of the project are captured below:  1. Development and application of 3D µCT (Bristol, Imperial) and Raman spectroscopy (Exeter, Imperial) methods to capture data describing the structural architecture, crystallinity, degree of mineralisation and carbonate content of 2 bone specimens (fetal and infant).  2. The development of 2 finite element models for these bones (using Scan IP FE, Abaqus, Avizo) to visualise, quantify, and model the material and structural evolution between the different time steps.  3. Employing the 3D volumetric data, 3D print the different architectures for mechanical assessment (at an engineering length scale) to understand how these complex forms of organized matter emerge, and how they resist structural loading. This will provide an insight into the structural survival strategies against compressive loading.

      " Dance digitisation takes on new meaning in light of 21st century development of digital and networked media combined with important changes in contemporary dance practice. These changes in dance are evidenced by the growing commitment of dance artists to the development of self-determined discourse, opening up new channels of communication about and through their work. Some of these artists have been experimenting with the possibilities of digital technologies to record, process and transmit their knowledge to others resulting in the creation of interactive installations, DVDs/ book combinations and on line digital archives and education platforms. This project will examine these developments and has the following overarching questions: \n",
      " What influence has the digitisation of movement practices, and the data that emerges, had generally on the Movement and Computing field and specifically the area of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) \n",
      " In what ways have movement/data researchers drawn on different expert practices and theoretical frameworks to support the digitisation of movement practices and what are the outcomes of these connections? \n",
      " What kinds of tools and technological processes participate in the digitisation of dance and movement practices and how could these be developed to further push the potential of a movement/data/technology nexus? \n",
      " What new insights to dance and movement systems have emerged through the digitisation process? What is the potential of 3D Immersive VR for research into dance digitisation? \n",
      " How has movement knowledge and theories of embodiment expanded and/or changed through digitisation processes? \n",
