      " You will, under the direction of Professor Lalvani, use recently-developed new immunological techniques to define and validate novel biomarkers of TB infection and disease. The technologies that will be evaluated and further developed include (but are not limited to): flow cytometry, ELISA, ELISpot, fluorescence linked immunospot, and multi cytokine bead array.  These assays will be applied to a unique prospectively collected bio bank of clinical samples from over 1000 TB patients.  You will conduct your own analyses of the data generated using appropriate statistical analyses and software packages. Using these approaches you will seek to systematically evaluate these novel diagnostic biomarkers of TB.  The position is funded by the NIHR and is focused on the newly launched high-profile translational research programme called “Validation of New Technologies for Diagnostic Evaluation of Tuberculosis (VANTDET)”. \n",
      " The research work to be undertaken will be carried out to an excellent standard.  The expectation is that studies will be publishable in internationally competitive journals. You will also help to develop research projects and grant applications in allied areas of fundamental importance to the understanding of TB. \n",

The energy surface corresponding to these interactions can be calculated from first-principles, in theory allowing physical properties to be derived ab-initio from a molecular simulation; that is by theory alone and without the need for any experiments. Recently we have focussed on applying these techniques to model carbon dioxide properties, such as density and phase separation, for applications in Carbon Capture and Storage. However, there is enormous potential to exploit this approach in a huge range of applications. A significant barrier is the computational cost of calculating the energy surface quickly and repeatedly, as a simulation requires. In collaboration with the School of Chemistry we have recently developed a machine-learning technique that, by using a small number of precomputed ab-initio calculations as training data, can efficiently calculate the entire energy surface. This project will involve extending the approach to more complicated molecules and testing its ability to predict macroscopic physical properties. \n",

These relate to the potential availability of significantly enhanced quality, coverage and level of detail in data concerning the movement of goods and people.

So called ‘User Generated Content (UGC)’ related to transport, mobility and demand for access to goods and services is now generated from static sensors, pervasive devices, transactional records and unstructured textual data. A set of associated Big Data from transport related sectors including education, entertainment, retail, health, finance and security have also emerged. This new data allows new approaches to answering some of the grand challenges for the transport and related sectors: reducing congestion, reducing the carbon-energy burden from the transport sector, improving accessibility, human led policy design, improving long term city planning and sector integration, developing mobility strategies for tackling new challenges such as disease/epidemic dispersion, food security, better management of key transport related infrastructure and assets for all modes, and enhanced security, safety and travel experience.

      "<p>You will work full time as a computer vision researcher on an exciting interdisciplinary project entitled: ‘Archival Polar Photography – Unearthing the Forgotten Record of Glacier Change’, funded by the Leverhulme Trust. The project aims to extend the record of historical glacier change further into the past by utilising the imagery held in the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) Picture Library – one of the most comprehensive collections of polar imagery in the world. You will collaborate with the SPRI picture library and with Glaciologists and Computer Scientists in York to extract information on the past extent of glaciers and ice bodies in Antarctica and Greenland from archival imagery. By comparing these findings with modern satellite and aerial imagery, the work will extend our record and understanding of changing ice extent back into the past by up to several decades, thus significantly lengthening the current record and aiding our understanding of the changes being experienced by these ice masses.</p>\n",
      "<p>You will focus on a) selecting and combining existing computer vision algorithms, b) developing new computer vision algorithms and c) implementing systems for i) clustering, geolocating and computing 3D models from the archival imagery as well as ii) registering archival imagery to modern satellite data.

The host department is ACCIS. \n",
      " The aim of the project is to take the first step towards designing and creating engineering structures with ontogenetic adaptation as observed in living bone; structures which adapt in response to external loading to overcome design uncertainties. Taking this first step requires an improved understanding of (1) how complex forms of organized matter emerge within the body, and (2) how these materials and structures assemble and remodel in response to stimuli (i.e. mechanical stress) over the life course.  You will have a PhD in materials science/mechanical engineering. Experience of physical or mechanical testing of materials and finite element modelling is essential. Interest or experience in bioengineering, healthcare engineering, or bone biology is an advantage.  In this investigation, the work is primarily experimental with supporting computational components. The specific objectives of the project are captured below:  1. Development and application of 3D µCT (Bristol, Imperial) and Raman spectroscopy (Exeter, Imperial) methods to capture data describing the structural architecture, crystallinity, degree of mineralisation and carbonate content of 2 bone specimens (fetal and infant).  2. The development of 2 finite element models for these bones (using Scan IP FE, Abaqus, Avizo) to visualise, quantify, and model the material and structural evolution between the different time steps.  3. Employing the 3D volumetric data, 3D print the different architectures for mechanical assessment (at an engineering length scale) to understand how these complex forms of organized matter emerge, and how they resist structural loading. This will provide an insight into the structural survival strategies against compressive loading.
