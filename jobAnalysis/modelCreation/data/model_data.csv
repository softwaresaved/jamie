 Campus:  Hull 
 Faculty/Area:  Faculty of Science and Engineering 
 The University of Hull is making a significant investment in the Department of Chemistry. The Department has undergone expansion over recent years with investment both in staff and facilities – making us one of the largest and most prestigious departments within the University. 
 The Department currently has 32 academic staff and a cohort of 65 postgraduate and 689 undergraduate students. The Department’s vibrant research activity falls into three main themes Biological Chemistry, Chemical Process Technology and Materials Chemistry. The Department occupies two buildings at the heart of the main campus and was recently joined to the new Allam Building for Biomedical Research and Centre for Positron Emission Tomography. 
 We are seeking to recruit a Postdoctoral Research Assistant to perform research in the interdisciplinary area of Biological Chemistry in support of the bionanoscience research programme of Professor David Evans, Head of Department. The duties will include innovative research, establishing a well-founded bionanoscience laboratory, laboratory management and day-to-day supervision of members of the research group including postgraduate and undergraduate students. 
 The bionanoscience research programme utilises plant viruses and virus-like particles as nanobuilding blocks, scaffolds or templates. The research in this exciting multidisciplinary field sits at the interface of chemistry, biology, materials science and medicine. The Evans Group has shown that inorganic, organometallic, organic and biomolecular moieties can be chemically linked to the virus surface, that the virus particles can be assembled into arrays on solid supports in a controlled fashion and that the external surface of the virus can template mineralisation for the preparation of narrowly disperse metallic nanoparticles. Further, the internal cavity of empty virus-like particles is being assessed as a carrier of cargo. These and related systems are being developed for applications such as targeted drug delivery, diagnostics and imaging. 
 Candidates should already have obtained a PhD or equivalent in Chemistry, Biology or a relevant discipline. Those with research experience in bionanoscience and/or interdisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry/ biology/ materials science/medicine are particularly encouraged to apply. The successful candidate will need to work independently, effectively and reliably. 
 The post is available immediately and will be offered on a fixed-term basis for a period of 48 months. 
 Informal enquiries may be directed to Professor David Evans, Department of Chemistry. Telephone: 01482 466766 or email:  david.evans@hull.ac.uk

 Fixed-term: The funds for this post are available for 3 years in the first instance. 
 Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in the group of Dr Pietro Cicuta. The position is sought to A Post-Doctoral Research Associate is sought to support the more ""biological"" side of an interdisciplinary project on the Hydrodynamic Synchronisation of motile cilia. This project is within a recently funded ERC Consolidator grant, and builds on recent work by our group that had focused on model and artificial systems.  The new line of work will involve culturing ciliated epithelial cells, controlling their density, spatial location, and properties of the surrounding fluid.    Through advanced optical imaging, the spatial correlations in this reconstructed ciliated epithelium will be measured.   In collaboration with others in the team, we will also explore the robustness of synchronisation against perturbations, by deploying optical tweezers and microfluidic channel devices. 
 The successful candidate may have quite different disciplinary background, but needs to be confident in techniques including cell culture and optical imaging, and be prepared (if not already expert) to pick up on a variety of ""quantitative"" aspects that are relevant in this research, including elements of fluid dynamics, rheology, soft matter physics, non-linear dynamical systems.  The biology knowledge underlying our questions is also quite broad, spanning from molecular biology (molecular motors, microtubules, cytoskeleton) to cell biology (signalling and feedback to cilia), and up to tissue organisation, development of ciliated epithelia, and the genetic or acquired disfunctions of motile cilia. Experimentally, confidence with custom equipment, and scripting in computer languages for instrument control and data analysis, would be helpful. 
 The successful applicant will hold (or be about to complete) a PhD or equivalent degree in a Life Science or Medical area;  Physical Sciences or Engineering doctoral degrees will also be considered provided the candidate has worked in interdisciplinary environments and can demonstrate the required background skills.  Relevant experience should be demonstrated by previous work in experimental cell biology, ideally on questions relevant to the research proposed here. 
 Skill-sets to rapidly be able to perform in vitro optical microscopy experiments on ciliated epithelial cells are essential, as are a strong ability to work both independently and as part of a team, and strong communications skills both written and oral. 
 Informal enquiries should be addressed to Dr Pietro Cicuta by email:  pc245@cam.ac.uk

 Applications are invited for a Research Associate to join a multidisciplinary project developing new methods for modelling subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers, hosted by the Novel Reservoir Modelling and Simulation ( NORMS ) group in the  Department of Earth Science and Engineering  at Imperial College London.  NORMS develops and applies new methods to accurately model complex geological heterogeneities in subsurface reservoirs.  
 The successful applicant will develop and apply leading-edge techniques to capture geological heterogeneity that centre on a surface-based modelling approach to representing key geological features, coupled to the use of adaptive unstructured meshes.  This will include the development of concepts and algorithms for surface-based modelling.  The methods will be tested using data from well-exposed outcrop analogues from a variety of depositional environments around the world, and will be applied to simulate subsurface flow processes in a companion project using Imperial College’s ground breaking flow simulation software IC-FERST. 
 This is an exciting opportunity for a talented individual to work within a large multi-disciplinary research group developing and applying advanced modelling techniques.  The post is funded by TOTAL and is part of a substantial research program at Imperial College to develop novel methods for reservoir modelling.  The successful candidate will be expected to regularly publish papers in international refereed journals, and present their research at relevant international conferences. 
 Applicants should be educated to PhD level (or equivalent) and have a background in earth science, geophysics, physics, mathematics, engineering, or computer science.  Experience in one or more of the following areas is desirable but not essential: sedimentary and/or structural geology, reservoir modelling, code development, meshing of complex structures.  Given the cross-disciplinary nature of the research it is expected that training in some aspects of the research will be required. 
 You will join a dynamic, close-knit, interdisciplinary research team, working on a challenging project to generate new technology for improved oil and gas recovery, management of freshwater reservoirs, and CO 2  sequestration.  Your research will also contribute to Imperial College’s ongoing commitment to deliver advanced modelling capabilities for hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers. The successful applicant will be encouraged to develop their research career over a longer timescale within this framework and to liaise closely with our industry sponsors. 
 Applications should be made via   http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/employment .    Select “Job Search” and enter the job reference EN20140240FH.  Applications should include a completed application form, curriculum vitae (resume), list of publications, brief statement describing why your skills and experience are relevant to the post, and the names and contact details of at least three referees.

 Based within the Faculty of Engineering and Environment, you will work with Professors Laurence Brockliss (Oxford University) and Michael Moss (Northumbria University) on a ESRC-funded project on the emergence of the professions during the Victorian period. The research will make a major contribution to the study of class formation in Victorian Britain and the debate about the existence of a distinct and hegemonic professional cohort with its own norms and values within the broader middle class. The research will primarily consist of the creation of a prosopographical database of about 20,000 key individuals drawn from a sample of professional people living in eight towns in 1851. The database will include information about their antecedents and descendants harvested from a variety of sources, including family history social network sites. 
 You will make presentations to academic and non-academic audiences and mediate user generated content to the database. Although much of the initial data will be captured from online resources, you must be prepared to travel and research in local collections in Dundee particularly, and the three other northern towns and in the national libraries and archives in Edinburgh and London. You will hold a doctorate in a cognate subject, have experience of archival research in national archives and local record offices, and be very familiar with database technology and the use of online resources. Applications are encouraged from those with experience of working on British social history post-1750. Work space and IT equipment will be provided at Northumbria University.

 The School seeks three Fellowships in the area of Energy to appoint innovators in key interdisciplinary aspects of energy which offer major growth potential, such as: •    Energy whole systems unifying engineering whole systems and total system approaches. •    Energy storage technologies ranging from small to grid-scale and integration with intermittent renewables and waste heat. •    Energy efficiency technologies and crosscutting approaches to reduce end-use energy demand. The posts leverage the core strengths of the Energy Research Institute (ERI) and the Centre for Integrated Energy Research (CIER), in renewables, whole systems and the use of energy (especially in transport), to enable us to tackle crosscutting industrial and societal challenges in energy. To move to the next level we need people who can unify our various approaches to energy. These posts would enable ERI and CIER to add value by connecting our unusual combination of energy activities, e.g. to integrate multiple energy generation and energy-efficiency technologies in a given application (e.g. urban energy systems). Energy is a key strategic area for interdisciplinary research at the university, as set out in the new University Strategic Plan and the posts leverage Leeds’ areas of strength. The perspective brought by these posts encompasses not only technologies (ERI’s core area), but how these interplay with policies, economics and social systems research across campus to transform our energy system in response to the energy trilemma; that of delivering affordable, secure and low-carbon energy. Key aims and overall benefits of the posts: •    Leveraging the energy research capabilities of ERI and the School by integrating these with the wider university energy theme, in research areas that place Leeds at the forefront. •    To enable us to equip UG and PGT students with both the energy technology in its broader industrial context and whole systems skills they will need to succeed in the modern engineering workplace, both for new and existing programmes. ERI is a leading institute for interdisciplinary energy research within the UK, and provides an excellent collaborative environment for prospective candidates. You will build capacity in research areas aligned with, and will benefit from the mutual support of recently appointed chairs in ERI and ETII (Energy Technology & Innovation Initiative). In addition, the positions will align with and support the aims of University-based centres in delivering high quality interdisciplinary energy research. 
 As part of the application process you will be required to upload the following documents: 1.    A CV; 2.    A list of publications; 3.    A statement detailing your research and academic plan (no more than 2 sides of A4).

 The newly established University of Oxford Nuffield Department of Population Health (NDPH) contains world-renowned population health research groups and provides an excellent environment for multi-disciplinary research and teaching. 
 Statistical Programming Training Fellowships are a new scheme within the CTSU and represent an exciting opportunity to support post-Masters statisticians in a period of early career training. The aim of the scheme is to give training in applied statistical programming, analytic and transferable skills, in preparation for the broader requirements of a career as a statistical scientist. 
 The very large-scale clinical and epidemiological data that are increasing available provide the opportunity for many exciting and extensive investigations but require high-quality well-structured data manipulation and statistical analysis programming to yield their full potential. Two specialist training fellowships are offered to candidates with a Masters in Medical Statistics or a closely related field involving substantial training in statistics. Statistical programming training will be provided in SAS, R and genetics software to attain milestones that will facilitate the fellows future ‘Big Data’ research. Eligible candidates for these opportunities will demonstrate excellent potential (on a par with competitive admission to a DPhil) to proceed to a research career involving advanced statistical programming and analyses of large-scale datasets. 
 The posts are full-time, fixed-term for 1 year and tenable from October 2015 to September 2016. 
 The closing date for applications is 12.00 noon on Friday 30 January 2015.

 The key responsibilities and duties are performing noise calculations on turbo-machinery designs likely to be the basis of the next generation of aero-engines and comparing results against experimental data provided by our project collaborators.  The work will also involve investigating calculation methods based on simplified flowfield models or analytic approaches for the propagation of sound across bladerows for use in multi-bladerow environments. The specific tasks will be: to apply, and develop where necessary, Navier-Stokes and Aero-Acoustic calculation methods and make comparison with test results; to explore the use of simpler lower-order models for noise propagation. 
 The skills, qualifications and experience required to perform the role are: candidates must have obtained (or be close to obtaining) a PhD in fluid mechanics, acoustics or a related discipline. Candidates must have experience of the major use of computational methods for fluid flows.  Candidates must also have a proven ability to work in a team and be able to communicate their ideas and results to others.  Some experience of developing analytic or semi-analytic models for sound propagation would be useful.

 In light of growing interest in and health of the discipline of Theology and the Arts at St Andrews we wish to make an appointment to help ensure that the Institute for Theology, Imagination and the Arts (‘ITIA’) in the School of Divinity at St Andrews continues to go from strength to strength. 
 All applicants must have appropriate academic qualifications in both some area of Theology and of the Arts, including an awarded PhD relative to the level of appointment sought, appropriate experience of successful teaching, assessment and supervision of students in a tertiary context is required, along with an ability to teach and supervise in some area of Christian Doctrine and Thought. A very strong commitment to research consonant with the interdisciplinary work of ITIA is essential, with a suitable record of research publications and the capacity to make an immediate contribution to the established research excellence of the School. The School will look for a clear programme of anticipated research activity over the coming years.  
 Applications will be accepted from candidates with a background in any major area of Theology and the Arts, but preference will be shown to applicants who complement the School’s existing strengths. This will mean we welcome applications from those with any specialism in Theology and the Arts’, although we are particularly keen to receive applications from those researching in Theology and the non-literary arts, such the visual arts, music, popular culture, film, drama and performance/ritual, however applicants with ‘literary’ specialisms will also be considered. A balance between complementing the existing staff members’ research strengths and the facility to co-operate with them on some project(s) is strongly desirable.  Applications from those with some experience as practitioners who also have the appropriate level of theological and interdisciplinary training and qualification are welcomed. 
 The successful candidate will also undertake administrative duties as directed by the Head of School. 
 Appointment will be from 1 September 2015, or as soon as possible thereafter, with placement according to qualifications and experience. 
 Please indicate which position you would like to be considered for in your application. 
 Informal enquiries to Dr Mark W Elliott, Head of School, e-mail  divhos@st-andrews.ac.uk , tel. 01334 462850, or Dr Gavin Hopps, Director of ITIA, email  grh10@st-andrews.ac.uk , tel. 01334 462837.

 Applications are invited for the above vacancy to work in the laboratory of Kris Clark on a project aimed at unraveling the molecular networks that promote the resolution of inflammation. The lab has recently identified a key role for the SIK family of protein kinases in regulating the phenotypic switch of macrophages from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state (Clark et al. PNAS 2012, 109, 16986-16991; Ozanne et al. Biochem J 2014, in press). The remarkable effects of small-molecule inhibitors of the SIKs on macrophage biology have identified these enzymes as attractive targets for the development of improved anti-inflammatory drugs. We are seeking a talented scientist whose research will lead to a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the SIKs control macrophage function. The person appointed will use state-of-the-art technologies in cell signaling, chemical biology, mass spectrometry and (phospho)proteomics to study SIK biology in primary cells from mice expressing inactive mutants of SIKs that we have recently generated.  This is a fixed-term post until 31st March 2018.  The successful candidate will be energetic and highly motivated with excellent interpersonal, organizational and communication skills. They will have an outstanding academic track record, hold a PhD in biochemistry, immunology or related discipline and have published in internationally recognized peer-reviewed journals. Preference will be given to candidates with a strong background in biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology. Experience in exploiting animal models of disease would be an advantage. MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (PPU):  This project will be performed in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (MRC-PPU), based within the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee. The MRC-PPU is one of the world’s most renowned centres for research on protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation ( http://www.ppu.mrc.ac.uk/ ). Many world leading researchers in the field of signal transduction have trained within the MRC-PPU. The major aims of the MRC-PPU are to advance understanding of the role of protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation in cell regulation and human disease, to facilitate the development of drugs to treat diseases caused by abnormalities in phosphorylation, to generate reagents and improve technologies. Another key remit of the MRC-PPU is to train the next generation of scientists who will advance our understanding in this crucial area of medical research. The MRC-PPU is in a beautiful location overlooking the estuary of the River Tay and embedded within the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee which is one of the premier Life Sciences research Centres in the world.

 Temporary contract for 36 months 
 We are seeking an Image Sensor and Simulation Scientist to work on the optimisation of a new CCD image sensor on board the forthcoming EUCLID spacecraft by the European Space Agency and to study the implications of radiation damage on the astronomical measurements that will be made by the mission. Euclid will seek to understand the geometry of dark energy and dark matter by accurately measuring the acceleration of the universe. The Visible Imager (VIS) instrument on EUCLID will use a 600 million pixel camera to measure the shape of distant galaxies to build a map of dark energy and dark matter through measurements of weak gravitational lensing.  You will join a vibrant team of scientists and engineers at the Centre for Electronic Imaging (CEI) and will play a key role in the electro-optical and radiation characterisation and optimisation of the new sensor and modelling of the CCD performance with regards to the radiation damage the sensor will receive in orbit. You will act as the interface between the engineering studies of the sensor at the CEI and the astronomical measurements and accuracies required by the weak gravitational lensing measurements of Euclid VIS through our international collaborators. You will have a good understanding of and experience in electro-optical characterisation of image sensors, data acquisition systems and data analysis, preferably alongside a background in astronomical measurements, preferably regarding gravitational lensing. A degree in a relevant discipline (e.g. electronic engineering or physics) is required, and a working knowledge of CCD image sensors, radiation damage effects in semiconductors and analogue electronics and modelling (both writing bespoke code and using publically available packages such as GEANT4) is desirable. You will be expected to be proficient in either sensors  or  astronomical measurements, although a working knowledge of both is preferable. You will be based in Milton Keynes, working closely with our industrial collaborators e2v Ltd., and our international partners the European Space Agency (ESA), Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL) and other partners. Good team working and inter-personal skills will be required, including the ability to travel to attend meetings in the UK and Europe.

Amongst the many aims are to carry out a census of accretion in the local universe and to precisely determine the radio/X-ray/mass `fundamental plane'. The ideal applicant would be competent in radio analysis and also have some competence in other wavebands, eg X-ray and optical/IR, as most of the science aims require correlation of radio properties with those in other wavebands. The successful applicant may also be involved in eMERGE, the largest eMERLIN legacy survey centred on GOODS-N, whose aim is to study the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate and of AGN. The position is available for 2 years in the first instance with a possible extension to 3 years. The starting salary is between £28,695 and £30,434 depending on experience. The Southampton Astronomy Group is one of the world's leading groups in the study of compact objects and variability across all wavebands and with interests in all scales from X-ray binary systems to cosmological. The Astronomy group is part of the School of Physics & Astronomy, which is ranked as a world top-30 Physics department. We are part of the larger Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering which brings together fundamental physics research with one of the UK's largest and strongest computer science departments. We are also part of the new STAG Institute (Southampton Theory, Astronomy and Gravitation) which combines researchers across Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics. The deadline for the receipt of application is 14 February 2015. The positions are available from 1 April 2015 but can be delayed for a suitable applicant.  For further enquiries contact Prof Ian McHardy (imh@soton.ac.uk).

 The School of Clinical Sciences has a vacancy for a Research Assistant working in the Academic Renal Unit. 
 This 1 year position is funded by a European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes awarded to Dr Rebecca Foster and Dr Simon Satchell, based in Dorothy Hodgkin Building, central Bristol. 
 The purpose of this study is to understand whether protection of the protective layer in blood vessels (the glycocalyx) by a growth factor produced by the kidney, (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) C), can ameliorate the development of albuminuria (leak of albumin into the urine) in kidneys. We have already shown that induced local production of VEGFC in the murine kidney can protect from the development of diabetic kidney disease and have preliminary evidence that this is acting on the glycocalyx. The hypothesis of this project is that, after glycocalyx disruption, VEGFC intervention will restore glycocalyx structure and kidney function.

 The main causes of tinnitus are noise-induced and age-related hearing loss which can result from a lifetime’s exposure to occupational or social noise. These impairments to the inner ear cause changes in the way that the hearing brain processes sound information. 
 We are now seeking to appoint a Research Fellow to a multi-disciplinary research team whose role is to create new knowledge that can underpin evidence-based practice for people with tinnitus. 
 The main project will lead the first step in developing standardised outcomes for evaluating tinnitus in clinical trials, using a range of methods including systematic review, focus groups, interviewing and Delphi survey, as appropriate. 
 This is an important study with potential for major international input. 
 The role holder will be involved with a European network of clinical and academic experts in tinnitus who are funded through the EU COST Action programme until 2018. The candidate also has the potential to involve patients in the research and also to become involved in other aspects of the BRU research team’s work, particularly with respect to trials of the audiological management of tinnitus. 
 The candidate will be involved in all aspects of research including development, design, implementation and dissemination of research findings. 
 Candidates should have a PhD or equivalent in a relevant scientific discipline. Training and skills in quantitative or qualitative research methods are essential. Candidates should also have an excellent working knowledge of relevant IT operating systems and software packages (including Windows and Microsoft Office), a good working knowledge of how to implement statistical software to analyse and interpret experimental data. Candidates should also possess communication skills demonstrating an ability to communicate on all levels within a multi-disciplinary team. Project management skills, demonstrating attention to detail, excellent organisation and planning are also essential along with good data management and database skills. The successful candidate will have made a substantial scientific contribution to manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals and will be developing a recognised national reputation in a relevant field.

 Applications are invited for a  12 month  Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (postdoc) position to develop new semiconductor X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy instrumentation for in situ analysis of deep water geological deposits of interest to the mining industry.   
 The project will be based in the Semiconductor Materials and Devices Laboratory of the award winning Sensor Technology Research Centre and is funded by the Science and Technologies Facilities Council.  Candidates with experience of developing Space Science Instrumentation are particularly encouraged to apply. 
 The project provides a unique opportunity to work at the cutting edge of semiconductor materials science and detector physics to develop new instrumentation that has relevance for multiple terrestrial and space applications, as well as immediate commercial potential.  Whilst the focus of the work is instrumentation to be deployed in Earth’s oceans, much of the work is also relevant to far future planetary science space missions to the oceans on icy moons such as Europa. 
 The successful candidate will conduct ground-breaking experimental research characterising the fundamental electronic and radiation detection properties of some of the highest performance semiconductor detectors and X-ray spectroscopy instrumentation ever made and also develop new readout electronics (low noise charge sensitive preamplifiers) tailored to the intended use.  
 The successful applicant may also contribute to the project through developing Monte Carlo simulations that model radiation interactions with semiconductor devices.  The project provides opportunity for interaction with researchers at the world-leading EPSRC National Centre for III-V Technologies where the semiconductor detectors will be grown and fabricated for the project.

 (Fixed Term for 24 months with the possibility for extension) 
 Expected start date:  As soon as possible 
 Applications are invited for a 24 months full-time postdoctoral position (with the possibility for extension) in Experimental Networked Quantum Information Technologies at the University of Sussex. Applicants should have obtained a PhD in experimental quantum information, laser- or atomic physics and be able to demonstrate working knowledge in this field. The appointment is within the framework of the EPSRC Quantum Technology Hub: Networked Quantum Information Technologies. The successful candidate will work in a team of experienced researchers directed by Dr Matthias Keller. 
 The goal of the project is to combine two of the most successful techniques in quantum information processing, individually trapped ions and strong-coupling cavity-QED, and use them as tools to set up a distributed quantum network. The principal challenge in the implementation of this scheme is the requirement for miniature-size traps and microscopic optical cavities to provide suitable conditions for a high-fidelity interface between ions and photons. In the project, technologies are developed to demonstrate distributed quantum information processing in a model system. This includes novel ion traps, laser sources and high-finesse optical cavities. 
 For further information please contact Dr Matthias Keller 
 Phone: +44 (1273) 877673, email:  M.K.Keller@sussex.ac.uk 
 Please include with your completed application form a CV, at least two references and a list of relevant publications.

 One year Research Fellow position   in collaboration with Nestlé Research Center, Lausanne, Switzerland 
 The objective of this Post Doctoral project is to understand the key mechanisms governing human swallowing and the link between bolus rheology, bolus lubrication and swallowing performance. 
 In a previous project, an experiment replicating the essential features of the peristaltic movement of the tongue was developed and used to study bolus propulsion during swallowing. This resulted in a publication, recently submitted to a high impact factor journal. 
 This project will improve the fidelity of the swallowing model experiment, focusing in particular on airway closure and the effect of a lubricant layer on bolus transport. 
 The ideal candidate has a strong background in fluid mechanics and rheology, a doctoral degree in chemical, mechanical engineering or physics and a strong publication track record. 
 Food in-mouth transformation and swallowing are the first steps in food uptake. As such, they are of the highest importance for food sensorial experience and preparation of food digestion. Deglutition is a complex physiological process involving the coordination of several movements, including an effective protection of the airways against unwanted entry of food. Dysphagia, swallowing pathologies are very frequent among elderly and are often addressed adapting food rheology and texture. 
 The project foresees a close collaboration with Dr. J.Engmann at Nestlé Research Center and a strong interaction with a partnering medical doctor. 
 This fellowship will last one year and should preferentially start on March 1 st , 2015. 
 Should you wish to have an informal discussion regarding the role, please contact Dr. M.Ramaioli, Senior Lecturer at the University of Surrey, email:  m.ramaioli@surrey.ac.uk

 The Institute of Cancer Research, London, is one of the world’s most influential cancer research institutes, with an outstanding record of achievement dating back more than 100 years. We provided the first convincing evidence that DNA damage is the basic cause of cancer, laying the foundation for the now universally accepted idea that cancer is a genetic disease. Today, The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) leads the world at isolating cancer-related genes and discovering new targeted drugs for personalised cancer treatment. Under the leadership of our Chief Executive, Professor Paul Workman FMedSci, the ICR is ranked as the UK’s leading academic research centre. Together with our partner The Royal Marsden, we are rated in the top four cancer centres globally. The ICR is committed to attracting, developing and retaining the best minds in the world to join us in our mission – to make the discoveries that defeat cancer. 
 The Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, within the Division of Cancer Therapeutics, is a multidisciplinary 'bench to bedside' centre, comprising around 160 staff dedicated to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Chemists from the Unit work alongside world-class biologists and drug metabolism specialists focusing on new molecular targets emerging from human genome and ground breaking cell biology research. The Unit’s exciting goal is to discover high quality drug candidates for validated biological targets and to progress these candidates to clinical trial. 
 One position is available for a postdoctoral chemist who will be located in well-equipped laboratories in Sutton. This position is within the Gene & Oncogene Targeting team, a multidisciplinary team led by Professor Caroline Springer, comprising chemists, biologists and pharmacokinetics specialists working in collaboration with world-class cancer research experts from the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute. 
 The position is in synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry applied to the discovery and optimisation of new drugs to treat cancer. The successful applicant will apply his/her knowledge to the design and synthesis of molecules of interest as anticancer agents and to the progression of our drug discovery programme to preclinical development. In addition, the successful applicant will develop skills in medicinal chemistry, target design and selection, as well as broader drug discovery knowledge. 
 Knowledge, experience and achievement in synthetic chemistry are essential. Past experience in medicinal chemistry is an advantage but not essential, as successful applicants will have ample opportunity to develop additional skills in post. This is an ideal opportunity for enthusiastic, committed chemists to make an important contribution to improved therapies for cancer patients, while gaining experience and training in drug discovery in an institute with a track record of success. 
 The appointment will be for 12 months in the first instance. Starting salary will be in the range £33,110 to £36,858 p.a. (based on relevance of skills and experience).

 A Research Fellow position is available for a two-year European Research Council (ERC)-funded project to undertake research on the design, evaluation and optimization of sophisticated vesicular systems for biosensing applications. The expected start date is June 2015 or later. 
 This project addresses the need to develop accurate, reliable, fast-responding and cost-effective biosensors that can offer high enough sensitivity to detect trace amounts or low levels of target molecules in complex biological samples. In this context, this interdisciplinary project aims to develop and synthetise a new generation of biosensors through innovations in the design and development of vesicle-based sensing systems. Self-assembly, vesicles, nanoreactors, reactivity of membranes, membrane coupled reactions and vesicle compartmentalization constitute the scope of the project. 
 The project is highly interdisciplinary and involves collaborations within the research group, as well as externally with experimental groups across University of Birmingham and other institutions. 
 A PhD in engineering, materials science, chemistry, physics or a related field is required for this position. Prior knowledge, experience and achievements in the design, synthesis and characterization of vesicular systems are required. 
 The postdoctoral fellow will join a productive research group within the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Birmingham.

 The Post 
 The University of Stirling is seeking to appoint a Lecturer in Social Work. The University has provided a postgraduate qualifying programme since 1972, and an undergraduate programme since 1992. There are currently two programmes:   • BA (Hons) in Social Work   • MSc in Social Work Studies   Both are approved for the Social Work qualification and took their first intakes in February 2005. There are normally around 100 qualifying students in full-time study in Social Work across the two years. There is also vibrant post-qualifying provision, including taught postgraduate programmes and courses in Child Welfare and Protection, Supervision, Leadership and Management, Social Services Management and Adult Services to over 400 part-time students.   SASS is seeking to appoint a full-time lecturer to the team.

 The School of Civil Engineering and Surveying, in collaboration with the School of Biological Sciences, is looking to recruit a Senior Research Associate to develop the capability of the University to engage with the Anaerobic Digestion Sector within the Region. This will require working closely with academic staff on projects to develop capabilities in feedstock and process assessment, digestate treatment and energy analysis (especially C-foot-printing\LCA). This will involve laboratory and field work, with practical monitoring and chemical analysis, combined with desk studies and modelling. This will lead to opportunities for publications and also preparation of research bids, which will hopefully enable the post, which is initially fixed term for 1-year, to be extended. 
 You will need a PhD, or Higher Degree preferably with industrial experience,  in Environmental Engineering or Science relating to aspects of Anaerobic Digestion. Practical laboratory skills, the ability to manage projects and excellent communication skills are essential. An important requirement is an entrepreneurial approach to science and technology and ability to identify and respond to industrial needs. 
 This is an exciting opportunity to develop a research career in a rapidly expanding field with a group of collegial academics committed to developing research and innovation linked to the needs of industry.

 Applications are invited for a Research Associate to work for two years on a project entitled "" Refugial populations at trailing-edge range margins: Attributes, survival and conservation ”. The project, carried out in collaboration with partners in the universities of York and East Anglia, as well as at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and Butterfly Conservation, seeks to: 
 a) identify the microclimatic and microhabitat (including vegetation composition) characteristics of local environments where species survive during periods when the climate “deteriorates”; 
 b) quantify the extent to which landscape-scale as well as local conditions contribute to the persistence of species, using dynamic models; 
 c) identify whether models which incorporate inter-annual variability of climatic (and hence inter-annual microclimatic variation) conditions predict survival better than those based on temporally-averaged micro- and macroclimatic conditions; 
 d) test the generality of our findings by examining the ability of our models to predict the survival of other northern species in Britain, and whether refugial locations coincide with protected areas; 
 e) use the tested models (a-d) to assess the implications of continuing climate change, identifying potential future refugia for species constrained by different components of climate; and 
 f) disseminate the conclusions from the study and identify potential conservation strategies to maximise species persistence under climate change. 
 The focal taxonomic group selected for study is butterflies, with a particular focus upon northern and upland species that reach southern and/or lower elevation range limits in Great Britain. 
 The successful applicant will join a research team of ten, comprising Profs. Chris Thomas (York), Jane Hill (York), Calvin Dytham (York) and Brian Huntley (Durham), Drs Aldina Franco (East Anglia), Tom Oliver (CEH Wallingford) and Richard Fox (Butterfly Conservation), and three post-doctoral research associates (to be appointed). They will have particular responsibility for compiling and/or calculating a range of environmental layers (including topography, microclimate, snow, vegetation/land cover) required as inputs to models to be developed that will be designed to address various of the project objectives. 
 Prospective candidates should have a first degree and PhD in relevant fields of biological or environmental science. Candidates must have a high level of expertise in computer programming using C, R and related languages, experience in the use of ArcGIS for spatial data display and analysis, and experience in the use of a high performance computing facility. Experience with dynamic models of ecological processes will be desirable, as will post-doctoral experience working in an ecological or related research field.

C. parvum is a protozoan parasite that causes severe enteric disease outbreaks in cattle worldwide, and is also zoonotic, causing disease in humans. Due to the lack of appropriate experimental systems, we know little about how the early interactions of host & parasite result in successful establishment of the parasite. Roslin scientists have developed in vitro methods allowing detailed examination of relevant cells from clinically relevant hosts, in this case the cow. 
 In this project we will use Roslin’s expertise & facilities to analyse the early stages of host-parasite interaction between C. parvum and bovine intestinal epithelial cells, using both primary epithelial cell cultures and a novel bovine organoid culture system that replicates the different cell types and interactions found in vivo. We will use microscopy & transcriptomics to unravel the dynamics of and identify the key host & parasite processes in successful C. parvum establishment in the bovine gut. You will possess a PhD in a relevant biological science and a record of innovative and high-quality research. Experience of work with primary cell culture is desirable. Knowledge of (bovine) immunology, pathogens and molecular biology would be advantageous. 
 You will have a proven ability to design, execute and interpret experiments, possess excellent skills in oral and written communication of results, and be highly motivated and work effectively independently or as part of a team.

 The Synthetic Biology Research Centre (SBRC) at the University of Nottingham is seeking dynamic, a high calibre microbial fermentation technologist to join a multidisciplinary team that is tackling one of the greatest challenges facing industry and society - the future sustainable production of chemicals and fuels. 
 SBRC Nottingham seeks to directly capture carbon, by harnessing the ability of autotrophic bacteria to consume’ single carbon gases (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane) and convert them into useful chemicals and fuels. By using non-food, waste gas as a feedstock for chemical and fuel production, competition with food and land resources is avoided while at the same time providing benefits to the environment and society through a reduction in Green House Gas emissions. 
 The gas fermenting chassis being investigated are both aerobic (Cupriavidus) and anaerobic (acetogens), but with a particularly emphasis on the former. These chassis are being engineered through a combination of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology to produce specific chemicals and fuels. We seek an individual with extensive experience in optimising the productivity of microbial process organisms in fermenters. Whilst the focus of the SBRC is the use of gas feedstock, the SBRC continues to also work with sugar-fermenting chassis (Clostridium and Geobacillus).   
 SBRC Nottingham is a centre created by the BBSRC/EPSRC in 2014 which has received £14.3M in funding for a 5 year period. It has a wealth of dedicated new equipment, bespoke gas fermentation facilities, cohorts of PhD studentships and many existing international research and industry connections.  www.sbrc-nottingham.ac.uk 
 The role holders will have the opportunity to use their initiative and creativity to identify areas for research, develop research methods and extend their research portfolio. 
 Candidates should hold a PhD (pending or awarded) in a discipline relevant to microbial strain engineering and have had demonstrable extensive past experience in the use of fermenters in their research. Additional skills in molecular microbiology would be an advantage.

 Applications are invited for a postdoctoral fellow to work on a 5 year project co-funded by the Medical Research Council and the Multiple Sclerosis Society, focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms driving central nervous system myelination and myelin repair, and how harnessing the regenerative properties of immune-derived factors is a potential strategy to overcome failure of this repair in multiple sclerosis. This University of Edinburgh team is focused on the regenerative properties of immune cell activation in the brain following injury with the goal of identifying new therapeutic strategies to treat diseases like multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy. The group uses a range of approaches from examination of post-mortem tissue to in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experimental modelling, molecular biology and bioinformatics.

 In 1839, Westminster was London’s first institution to demonstrate the world’s newest wonder, photography. With Europe’s first photographic studio opening on the roof of 309 Regent Street, then came the UK’s first moving picture to play in Westminster’s Regent Street cinema and the world’s first ever BSc in Photographic Science.

In the 2014 REF the Faculty achieved the highest UK ranking for world-leading research in general art and design, along with fourth for research in media and communications.

This dynamic and agile environment enables our students to thrive in a world where technology, entertainment and information are having an escalating impact on content, experiences and services across diverse contexts. 
 You will have experience, knowledge and skills that are rooted in stills / photographic practice, but will have extended these through a commitment to inter- and multi-disciplinary approaches to media production. You will also have experience of forms of distribution, display and professional working in today’s fast-changing media and cultural industries. 
 The role involves teaching at all undergraduate levels, as well as undertaking module and year leadership as part of a strong staff team. Key to this is the provision of academic and pastoral support to a diverse range of students. 
 You will have a relevant degree, as well as a postgraduate qualification and/or high level professional experience. You will be able to demonstrate teaching excellence, with a proven ability to provide stimulating guidance for the creative work of students. You will support this with organisational skills and an ability to design and deliver teaching materials and contribute to planning programmes of study. 
 You will have a record of professional practice and/or published/funded research which has been recognised as excellent at international level. Your technical skills will be current and aligned with trends in the media professions. You will have an in-depth understanding of the value of multi-disciplinary teams within the contemporary media industries. 
 You will be able to develop and maintain appropriate external links with industry, professions and other educational institutions relevant to BA Contemporary Media Practice and your own professional and/or research activity.

 Work closely with the Associate Dean - Research and the Executive Directors of Faculty Research Centres to deliver the School’s research portfolio, income generation and publication record;

 A postdoctoral position is available from 1st October 2015 in the group of James Fraser. The lab combines electrophysiological research with computer modelling to understand normal cardiac muscle physiology, cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. 
 You will be working on a BBSRC-funded ""Sparking Impact"" project. This will involve the further development of a cardiac muscle model in C++ to produce a user interface that will allow its use by untrained users and possible future commercialisation. This project might provide an ideal stepping stone from computer science or physics into biophysical modelling. 
 The successful candidate should hold a PhD in computer science, physics, biophysics or physiology, and must be familiar with C++. Experience with data visualisation and graphical user interface development would be a considerable advantage. Experience of physiology or biophysics would be helpful but is not essential. An ability to work independently and good communication skills are expected. 
 Fixed-term: The funds for this post are available for 6 months in the first instance.

 The UK’s healthcare system faces unprecedented challenges. Britain is the most obese nation in Europe and the country’s ageing population is especially at risk from isolation, depression, strokes and fractures caused by falls in the home. A pioneering new collaboration hopes aims to address these issues by developing a 24/7 digital home health assistant. 
 An interdisciplinary research collaboration (IRC) led by the University of Bristol together with the Universities of Southampton and Reading, has been awarded a grant by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) of almost £12 million. They will work in partnership with Bristol City Council, IBM, Toshiba and Knowle West Media Centre (KWMC). 
 The collaboration, known as SPHERE (Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in a Residential Environment), will develop home sensor systems to monitor the health and wellbeing of the people living at home. 
 The IRC’s vision is not to develop fundamentally-new sensor technologies for individual health conditions but rather to impact all these healthcare needs simultaneously through data-fusion and pattern-recognition from a common platform of non-medical/environmental sensors at home. 
 The system will be general-purpose, low-cost and accessible. Sensors will be entirely passive, requiring no action by the user and suitable for all patients, including the most vulnerable. An example of SPHERE’s home sensor system could be to detect an overnight stroke or mini-stroke on waking, by detecting small changes in behaviour, expression and gait. It could also monitor a patient’s compliance with their prescribed drugs. 
 Importantly, SPHERE will work hand-in-hand with the local community through Bristol City Council and its partners at KWMC. Leading clinicians in heart surgery, orthopaedics, stroke and Parkinson’s disease, and recognised authorities on depression and obesity will also be involved with the project, along with the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research, Bristol Health Partners and Bristol’s NIHR-funded Biomedical Research Units. 
 A new post has opened up within the project. You will take up a research post to develop middleware software for secure Internet of Things solutions in residential environments. 
 The work requires a thorough understanding of Internet of Things technology, energy efficient networking, security and IPv6 short range wireless sensor networks. 
 This post is offered on a part time (1 day per week) fixed term contract for 1 year in the first instance with the potential for further extension. The start date of this post for this post is 1st August 2015.

 Mathematical Modelling of the Atmosphere to Ocean Momentum Transfer by Sea Ice 
 The reduction of the Arctic sea ice cover is a prominent indication of climate change and has excited considerable scientific and general interest. The inability of climate models to adequately represent the rate of Arctic sea ice loss or the small increase in Southern Ocean sea ice has stimulated interest in the physical basis of the model representation of sea ice and ocean processes in the polar regions. 
 This project will focus on the atmosphere to sea ice to ocean momentum transfer in the Arctic and Southern Oceans. The model of air-sea ice and sea ice-ocean drag forces will be examined and modified to account for form drag and stability using theory and observations. The representation of these drag laws will be explored in climate sea ice models, coupled sea ice-ocean models, and atmosphere-sea ice-ocean models. The simulations will be compared to observations and analysed for their implications. 
 The successful applicant will have aptitude for, and previous experience of, numerical modelling of physical environmental systems and will join a research team investigating related aspects of the polar oceans. 
 You will have: 
 -  Significant skills in numerical modelling of physical systems using complex computer codes 
 -  Ability to formulate, under guidance, new representation of physical processes in mathematical form 
 -  Ability to modify complex computer codes with technical and physical consistency 
 -  Ability to interpret model simulations using understanding of the physical systems and observations, and analyse implications 
 - Ability to write viable scientific publications 
 -  PhD or equivalent in physical environmental science including at least one year of numerical modelling

 Applications are invited for a Research Assistant position to work on a joint project between the Advanced Composites Centre for Innovation and Science (ACCIS) in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, the Anthropology Imaging Laboratory, both at the University of Bristol, Engineering at the University of Exeter, and the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London. The host department is ACCIS. 
 The aim of the project is to take the first step towards designing and creating engineering structures with ontogenetic adaptation as observed in living bone; structures which adapt in response to external loading to overcome design uncertainties. Taking this first step requires an improved understanding of (1) how complex forms of organized matter emerge within the body, and (2) how these materials and structures assemble and remodel in response to stimuli (i.e. mechanical stress) over the life course.  You will have a PhD in materials science/mechanical engineering. Experience of physical or mechanical testing of materials and finite element modelling is essential. Interest or experience in bioengineering, healthcare engineering, or bone biology is an advantage.  In this investigation, the work is primarily experimental with supporting computational components. The specific objectives of the project are captured below:  1. Development and application of 3D µCT (Bristol, Imperial) and Raman spectroscopy (Exeter, Imperial) methods to capture data describing the structural architecture, crystallinity, degree of mineralisation and carbonate content of 2 bone specimens (fetal and infant).  2. The development of 2 finite element models for these bones (using Scan IP FE, Abaqus, Avizo) to visualise, quantify, and model the material and structural evolution between the different time steps.  3. Employing the 3D volumetric data, 3D print the different architectures for mechanical assessment (at an engineering length scale) to understand how these complex forms of organized matter emerge, and how they resist structural loading. This will provide an insight into the structural survival strategies against compressive loading.

 We are looking for a highly motivated individual with expertise in high-resolution imaging to join the group of Dr Anne-Marie Krachler ( https://sites.google.com/site/krachlerlab/ ) at the Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham as a postdoctoral research associate. 
 The position is funded by the BBSRC and is part of an exciting project, which aims to explore how bacterial adhesins with different lipid binding specificity modulate host signaling pathways and how this steers bacteria towards either commensal or pathogenic interactions with the host. 
 Candidates must have a PhD in biology, biochemistry, or a related discipline and experience in high-resolution imaging. They should also have a strong interest in working on mechanistic questions related to bacteria-host interactions. Since we use both tissue culture and zebrafish larval models of infection, previous experience in zebrafish work, tissue processing and tissue culture would be highly desirable. 
 Applicants will be expected to work closely with colleagues from different disciplines and to assist junior researchers in their work. Candidates should have excellent written and oral communication skills and be highly organized and able to prioritise their own work with minimal supervision.

 Applications are invited for the post of Research Fellow in Mathematical Biology of Cell Differentiation based in the Department of Microbial and Cellular Sciences within the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Surrey, one of the UK’s most prestigious universities. You will undertake research in a vibrant, inter-disciplinary research environment with an excellent international reputation. 
 You will be an important member of the research team investigating stem cell differentiation in zebrafish. In particular, the project focuses on developing a quantitative understanding of the gene regulatory network controlling fate choice from bipotent precursors in the neural crest, and exploring how the output of these networks is affected by stochastic fluctuations (noise) in gene expression. This is an exciting BBSRC-funded collaboration between the University of Surrey (Dr Andrea Rocco – FHMS, Mathematical Biology) and the University of Bath (Prof Robert Kelsh (Developmental Genetics) and Dr Hartmut Schwetlick (Applied Mathematics)) utilising and developing a Systems Biology approach, with strong interactions between experimental and theoretical components. 
 The post-holder, based in Surrey in the group of Dr Rocco, but closely interacting with Prof Kelsh and Dr Schwetlick, will be responsible for developing the theoretical aspects of the project. The main responsibility of the role will be to apply a combination of mathematical analysis techniques and simulations to construct deterministic and stochastic models of the gene regulatory network driving the differentiation process. The post holder is expected to liaise with the experimental team in Bath to develop the models, validate them, and inspire appropriate follow-up experiments.   
 Candidates for this post should have a PhD in Theoretical Physics or Applied Mathematics, very strong analytical and numerical skills, and be keen to work at the interface between mathematical modelling and Biological Sciences.  Experience with dynamical systems theory, statistical mechanics or stochastic processes, in particular Master Equations and Langevin formalisms, is highly advantageous. 
 In return we offer a generous annual leave allowance, defined pension scheme, exclusive discounted membership for the Surrey Sports Park, on-site childcare facilities and relocation allowance (where applicable), in addition to the opportunity to join one of the best Universities in the Country. 
 For an informal discussion about the role, please contact Dr Andrea Rocco via email at  A.Rocco@surrey.ac.uk .

 The Institute of Cancer Research, London, is one of the world’s most influential cancer research institutes, with an outstanding record of achievement dating back more than 100 years. 
 As part of The Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden Hospital Cancer Center, we are establishing a new integrative data sharing platform: “The Knowledge Hub”. This is an exciting new platform designed for sharing, integrating and exploring a wide range of data, including imaging, genomic, transcriptomic, chemoinformatic and clinical data, collected at the ICR and the RMH and connecting them to publicly-available datasets. The Knowledge Hub will, provide three main functionalities. Firstly, it will serve as a centralised database for Institute-wide usage; secondly, it will provide researchers with software tools to facilitate data mining and visualisation across different datasets; thirdly, it will offer predictive capabilities by e.g., identifying data patterns, sets of cancer biomarkers or likely drug targets for specific cancer sub-types, which will ultimately help researchers and clinicians take the best-informed decisions. Such an ambitious project can only be achieved in a place like the ICR and the RMH thanks to existence of a remarkably strong connection between the clinicians, scientists and informaticians. There is huge potential for scientific discovery in the mining of these data, something until now extremely challenging due to the lack a central, homogenous and easy-to-query data repository with effective analysis tools to facilitate unearthing hidden relationships in the data. 
 We are seeking a highly motivated, experienced graph/NoSQL data modeller and software developer who will help in the development, optimisation and exploitation of the Knowledge Hub. This includes implementing big data technologies, such as Hadoop and Map Reduce; designing, implementing and managing graph databases; assisting with the processing of the data, including data acquisition, storage and preparation and contributing to the development of back-end software tools for the retrieval of data products, which will be integrated with the data mining, visualisation and user-interface utilities. Knowledge of web design would be valued, as would experience in data-mining techniques. 
 SPECIFIC DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
 Implement big data solutions using tools like Hadoop and Map Reduce. 
 Design, implement and manage graph databases. 
 Liase with IT regarding maintenance of the server. 
 Develop back-end software tools for executing database queries in an optimal fashion. 
 Assist in linking back-end software tools to the user interface. 
 Design and implement fast and efficient data-processing techniques. 
 Participate in the preparation and storage of data to enable the data to be manipulated effectively. 
 Provide guidance on emerging big data technologies and methods to ensure the Knowledge Hub system is kept relevant. 
 Liaison with Scientific Computing team and scientific researchers on management of data sets and relevant IT infrastructure. 
 Capture information concerning new data sets. 
 Provide support for end users of the Knowledge Hub. 
 Web design and/or data-mining experience would be highly valued. 
 Experience working with life sciences data is a bonus.

 Due to funding restrictions it is unlikely an appointment will be made above £33,242 per annum. Appointment is subject to approval by the Leverhulme Trust 
 Contract Type:  Fixed Term (12 months) 
 Project Title: Towards Bionic Proteins - Tertiary Structures from Non-Natural Building Blocks 
 Full time for 12 months, available immediately 
 Funded by The Leverhulme Trust you will explore the design and synthesis of proteomimetics as components of functional proteins. You should have a strong background in bio-organic chemistry, and a PhD in chemical biology or synthetic chemistry. The project focuses upon the design and synthesis of small-molecules and their integration within functional protein architectures. A major challenge within contemporary chemistry is to reproduce the folding of biopolymers into functional 3D architectures as determined by primary sequence. Thus, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate that mimetics of protein secondary structure can replace components of a protein’s covalent structure to result in new semi-synthetic biomolecules capable of function. The project will involve extensive use of polypeptide and total protein synthesis, cloning and protein expression and biophysical techniques.

 The University is committed to supporting and promoting equality and diversity in all of its practices and activities. We aim to establish an inclusive environment and particularly welcome applications from diverse backgrounds.   
 This is a fixed term position from 1st November 2015 until 31st October 2018. 
 We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral researcher to join a 3-year, NERC-funded collaboration investigating “Interactions between sources of environmental change: How do resource quality and coloured environments modify multi-trophic eco-evolutionary dynamics?”. 
 This project will combine experimental and theoretical components to develop our understanding of how population dynamics of the Indian meal moth,  Plodia interpunctella , a stored-product pest species, are impacted by multiple stressors (resource quality, temperature fluctuations and natural enemies).  
 This 3-year position, based in Swansea, will focus on developing theoretical/mathematical stochastic population models that will generate insight and improve our understanding of the dynamics of species with complex life-cycles in variable environments, working with Drs. Mike Fowler (Biosciences) and Chenggui Yuan (Maths). The project partner at the University of Leeds (Dr Steve Sait) will run complementary lab experiments, generating time-series of  Plodia  populations under pre-determined stochastic conditions, taking detailed measurements of population densities and life-history traits, e.g., larval development times. Different experiments will inform model development and provide data-sets to contrast and validate models against. We aim to statistically compare stage-structured population models with Integral Projection Models to determine which models capture the dynamics best.  
 The successful candidate will work closely with team members in Swansea and Leeds.

 This is an exciting opportunity to work as part of a research team examining developmental changes in the way children and adolescents think about the past and the future. 
 The project will examine whether children and adolescents show particular biases in the way that they think about the future that have previously only been observed in adults. It will focus on a set of temporal asymmetries that seem to reflect an orientation or bias towards the future. These include the tendency to value future experiences more than past ones, to report stronger emotions when thinking about the past than the future, to judge future misdemeanours more harshly than past ones, and to judge that times in the future feel closer than times an equivalent distance in past. The project will investigate the developmental profile of these asymmetries and also how they may relate to measures of temporal orientation. 
 The project is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) for  28 months  and is being directed by Professor Teresa McCormack in collaboration with Professor Eugene Caruso, University of Chicago.

 You will join an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinician researchers studying the contribution of a mis-regulated immune response to the pathogenesis of a wide variety of diseases. The focus of this project is to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive aberrant inflammation in the tumour microenvironment; specifically by defining how the extracellular matrix directs immune cell phenotype within the tumour stroma. This position will employ a combination of in vitro cellular and molecular techniques, ex vivo and in vivo models of disease, and patient samples to examine the mechanism by which endogenous danger signals drive inflammation during tumorigenesis and determine their value in defining the prognosis and treatment options for cancer patients. 
 Main responsibilities will include the planning and execution of high quality research, providing guidance and support for PhD students, writing research papers for publication and data presentation to a variety of audiences. 
 You will hold a PhD in biochemistry or immunology and have experience in the analysis of the impact of the tumour microenvironment on tumour cell phenotype and/or in the analysis of immune cell biology and polarization. Required skills include differentiation, culture and stimulation of primary human and murine immune cells (myeloid and lymphoid), 3D tumour co-culture systems, and protein expression and purification. Experience in CyTOF mass spectrometry analysis would be an advantage.

 Applications are invited to the above role to perform modelling research on bacterial predators. The project investigates the function of predatory  Bdellovibrio  bacteria against pathogenic bacterial pathogens by a group of four postdoctoral researchers at Nottingham and in collaboration with other researchers in the UK, and with a modelling group, and immunologists at Nottingham. This is an exciting opportunity to join a multi-disciplinary team working together on a large cross-disciplinary project on predatory bacteria. 
 The person appointed will develop computational and/or mathematical system models which capture interactions between  Bdellovibrio , a range of prey bacteria, and the host organism immune system. The appointee will need to establish which parameters and data are key to construct and validate the models, and work closely with the wet lab researchers regarding experimental design to determine which experiments need to be conducted (were possible) to obtain these data and parameters, and to ensure candidate models produce predictions which are experimentally verifiable. The person appointed will be co-located in the School of Life Sciences with a team of other  Bdellovibrio  wet lab researchers and benefit from training and working in a good team environment. They will work with three other postdoctoral fellows. A dedicated technician will also support the research of the team. 
 This work is funded by a US funder and travelling to US reporting meetings once or twice during the project will included. There is a requirement to contribute data/modelling updates to monthly reporting meeting with the funder. The appointee will work with Dr Jamie Twycross from the Intelligent Modelling and Analysis (IMA) Group, School of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham, with Prof Liz Sockett (the overall experimental PI), and with a programme manager who will manage the reporting and liaise with the postdoctoral fellows and technician. Although the successful applicant will primarily be located in Life Sciences, regular interaction with other researchers in the IMA group in Computer Science will be expected. The successful applicant will also be required to work at times in collaboration with other project partners in the UK, including pathogen specialists and a structural biologist. 
 Candidates must hold a PhD or equivalent (or be close to completion) in computational or mathematical modelling, preferably with a strong microbiological modelling component. It is essential that they have demonstrated excellent skills in variety of modelling and data analysis approaches.  In addition they must have experience of collaborating with other researchers, because teamwork is important in the project.  The person appointed will need to keep accurate confidential records, write publications and reports, and give internal presentations to the group and others. 
 This full-time fixed-term post is available immediately and will be offered until 31 March 2018.

 We are seeking expertise to further develop the ontology for the EMOTIVE engine. The ontology was originally designed as part of the EMOTIVE and ReDites projects funded by EPSRC and the Defence Science & Technology Laboratory (dstl) -  http://emotive.lboro.ac.uk/ ,  http://emotive.systems . It will involve working with Prof Thomas Jackson and Dr Martin Sykora and their research team to develop and evaluate the ontology. This will be based on ongoing research efforts, that is, to extend the EMOTIVE taxonomy through conducting further research in psychology of emotion, incorporating further linguistic enhancements to the functions of expressing emotions such as, intensifiers, interjections, negators, domain semantics and also increasing the content with non-standard English. This will also require a thorough review of research literature, with the view to publishing in academic conferences / journals. The intention is also to explore the development of the ontology in Arabic. 
 The successful applicant should hold a Ph.D qualification along with experience with OWL/Protégé and knowledge of Arabic. 
 Interviews will take place during the morning of on Tuesday 1st December 2015.

 We seek to appoint a Research Fellow to undertake original postdoctoral research within the framework of the project  Knowing From the Inside: Anthropology, Art, Architecture and Design  (KFI), which is funded by the European Research Council. 
 The post will be situated within the Department of Anthropology in the School of Social Science. For details of the Department, see  http://www.abdn.ac.uk/socsci/disciplines/anthropology/ . Information on the School is available at  http://www.abdn.ac.uk/socsci/ . The School of Social Science is part of the College of Arts and Social Sciences. More information on the College is available at  http://www.abdn.ac.uk/cass/ . 
 The Fellow will undertake research based in sub-project 2 of KFI:  Crafting relations: skills, materials, environments.  This sub-project focuses on the interplay between arts or craft practitioners, the materials they use and the surroundings in which they work. It will investigate the relation between ways of producing and ways of observing, or between creativity and perception, guided by the hypothesis that the movements entailed in making artefacts are intimately coupled with those entailed in sensory perception. Practitioners watch, listen and feel as they work. In line with the overall approach of the KFI project, the aim is not to make a study  of  practitioners but to work  with  them, so as to develop a sensitivity to materials and environment which could inform our own, anthropological ways of working. 
 The Fellow will also play a key role in curating the KFI project exhibition, scheduled for spring 2017, and in assisting with the production of the associated catalogue and publications. Subject to agreement, the exhibition, its preparation and curation could provide an appropriate experimental context for the investigation outlined above. 
 Salary will be at the appropriate point on the Grade 6 salary scale (£31,342 - £37,394 per annum) with placement according to qualifications and experience. Consideration will be given to making an appointment at Research Assistant level for those candidates in the final stages of completing their PhD (salary range £26,274 - £29,552 per annum pro rata). 
 This post is funded by the European Research Council. It will commence no earlier than January 1 st  and no later than March 1 st  2016, and will extend for a period of 19.5 months from the start date.

 One post in the MRC Biostatistics Unit Hub for Trials Methodology Research: Cambridge, UK. 
 The MRC Biostatistics Unit is one of Europe’s leading biostatistics research institutions. We have one of the founding hubs for trials methodology research and have a large group of adaptive clinical trial design researchers. Our adaptive designs group has developed methods in a variety of areas including: dose-escalation designs for Phase I, early experimental designs for response-adaptive dose-ranging designs, optimal multi-arm multi-stage designs and more recently biomarker-driven adaptive trials. 
 We have recently been involved as a co-applicant in a successful grant application to the Innovative Medicines Initiative to investigate novel trial designs within type I diabetes. Part of your role will be to model longitudinal measurements of biomarkers within children, who have elevated risk of disease progression. These data may contribute to the development of novel intermediate biomarkers that would be of great use within the eventual design of trials. New trial designs will be developed that can use the longitudinal modelling information combined with intervention studies that find the best doses or treatments within a small experimental setting. 
 We now seek an Investigator Statistician (band 4) to support this grant activity. There will be numerous meetings within Europe as the work will contribute to one work package within this European collaboration. You will need a PhD in Statistics or a relevant subject, or be in the final stages of obtaining your PhD. 
 Starting salary will be in the range of £27,355-£32,648 per annum, supported by a flexible pay and reward policy, 30 days annual leave entitlement, and an optional MRC final salary Pension Scheme. 
 The MRC is a unique working environment where our researchers are rewarded by world class innovation and collaboration opportunities that the MRC name brings. Choosing to come to work at the MRC means that you will have access to a whole host of benefits from a final salary pension scheme and excellent holiday entitlement to access to employee shopping/travel discounts and salary sacrifice cycle to work scheme and childcare vouchers, as well as the chance to put the MRC on your CV in the future.

 Summary 
 Applications are invited for the position of Research Assistant at the Cognition, Schizophrenia, and Imaging (CSI) lab at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London. 
 The CSI Lab seeks to understand mechanisms underlying the symptoms of schizophrenia. The ultimate aim of the CSI Lab's research programme is to use that understanding to develop more effective treatments. The majority of the CSI Lab's studies use brain imaging techniques to understand the function and structure of brains of people who have schizophrenia relative to people who have no experience of psychosis. 
 We are currently running a study investigating the mechanisms underlying treatment response in psychosis (MUTRIPS). We will be recruiting patients with first episode psychosis in order to establish cognitive and neuroimaging markers which can be utilized to predict treatment response. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 6-month intervals over a period of 2 years, assessing measures of cognitive control, brain connectivity, and neurochemistry. 
 Details 
 We wish to appoint a self-motivated Research Assistant to work on the MUTRIPS project. Under the supervision of Professor Sukhi Shergill, the post holder will be responsible for: 
 - liaising with clinical teams to screen for potential participants 
 - recruitment and consenting of research participants 
 - data collection (behavioural and fMRI) 
 - data entry, maintenance, and analysis 
 - lab management duties such as organising and administering lab resources 
 The closing date for receipt of applications is 30 December 2015.  
 Interviews will be held shortly after the closing date. 
 Equality of opportunity is College policy. 
 Salary 
 The appointment will be made, dependent on relevant qualifications, within the Grade 5 scale, currently £27,328 to £28,982, per annum plus £2,323 per annum London Allowance.

 The Department of Clinical Neurosciences, which is based on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus was formed in 2004 and brings together the University Divisions of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Stem Cell Neurobiology, the John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair and the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre. The Department works alongside the existing Addenbrooke's NHS Trust Clinical Division of Neurosciences. The emphasis of research is on basic and applied neuroscience with the specific aims of understanding mechanisms of injury and repair in common diseases of the central nervous system. The clinical emphasis is on demyelinating disease, neurodegeneration, behavioural neurology, stroke and brain injury using clinical, genetic, immunological and imaging approaches. 
 This new role is commensurate with the appointment of Professor Chinnery as leader of a University research programme affiliated to the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit (MBU). This accompanies his relocation to the University of Cambridge as Professor of Neurology and Head of the Department of Clinical Neurosciences. The post will be administratively based within the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, but will be based physically within the MBU housed in the Wellcome Trust/MRC Building on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. 
 Professor Chinnery is Wellcome Trust Senior Fellow in Clinical Science. His laboratory research group studies the mechanisms responsible for human mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondria are the 'power house' within the cell. Mitochondrial dysfunction causes progressive multi-system diseases that usually affect the nervous system and have no treatment. The over-arching aim of his research group is to develop new treatments for mitochondrial diseases using a combination of genomic, cell biology, and informatic techniques on human tissue samples, and using cell and animal disease models. The MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit includes eight other research groups studying the fundamental biology of mitochondria, how this changes in disease, and how to harness this knowledge to develop treatments. The unit has state-of-the-art facilities available to group members. 
 The purpose of this role is to support and maintain the University's national and international reputation for excellence in teaching and research. Contribution to excellence in research will be as a member of a research team carrying out research under the direction of Professor Chinnery to include data collection, analysis and some interpretation using a variety of molecular, genetic and cell biology techniques. Contribution to publications will be strongly encouraged. 
 Although primarily a research role, the role will also have additional senior responsibility with oversight of research projects carried out by graduate students, the procurement of equipment and reagents, health and safety and project management. This will involve representing the group on relevant committees within the MBU and ensuring that the research group adheres to safe working practices 
 Fixed-term: The funds for this post are available until 30 September 2018 in the first instance.

 Research Project: Ice-Nucleating Particles in the Marine Atmosphere (MarineIce); an ERC funded project. 
 We seek an ambitious individual to develop a new microfluidics instrument for the detection and quantification of atmospheric ice nucleating particles. This project is part of a large €2.7 M European Research Council Consolidator fellowship led by Dr Ben Murray, which is focused on quantifying the concentration of ice nucleating particles in remote marine locations. This builds on our recent work which shows that there is a biogenic marine source of INPs (Wilson et al. Nature, 2015). This study highlights the need for instruments which are capable of making semi-autonomous measurements of INP concentrations with very high sample statistics and low detection limits. 
 Your primary role will be to use your microfluidics expertise to develop a novel microfluidics device for quantifying INP. This will involve working with Dr Jung-uk Shim, a microfluidics expert based in Physics in Leeds. You will also be embedded within the Ice Nucleation group in the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science. Part of this project will involve taking the new instrument into the field, in close collaboration with the other group members, in order test it and also produce much needed datasets. 
 You will have an experimental PhD (or close to submission) in some field of Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science, Engineering, or a related discipline. You will also have experience in design and construction of microfluidics lab-on-a-chip devices as well as the ability to use drawing tools such as AutoCAD for the design of microfluidics devices. 
 The University of Leeds’ commitment to women in science has been recognised with a national accolade. The University has received the Athena Swan Bronze Award in recognition of our success in recruiting, retaining and promoting women in Science, Engineering and Technology (SET).

 Machine learning for first-principles calculation of physical properties 
 Supervised by Dr Richard Graham (Maths) and Dr Richard Wheatley (Chemistry) 
 This project will be based at the University of Nottingham at the School of Mathematical Sciences and the School of Chemistry 
 The physical properties of all substances are determined by the interactions between the molecules that make up the substance. The energy surface corresponding to these interactions can be calculated from first-principles, in theory allowing physical properties to be derived ab-initio from a molecular simulation; that is by theory alone and without the need for any experiments. Recently we have focussed on applying these techniques to model carbon dioxide properties, such as density and phase separation, for applications in Carbon Capture and Storage. However, there is enormous potential to exploit this approach in a huge range of applications. A significant barrier is the computational cost of calculating the energy surface quickly and repeatedly, as a simulation requires. In collaboration with the School of Chemistry we have recently developed a machine-learning technique that, by using a small number of precomputed ab-initio calculations as training data, can efficiently calculate the entire energy surface. This project will involve extending the approach to more complicated molecules and testing its ability to predict macroscopic physical properties. 
 Summary : UK/EU students - Tuition Fees paid, and full Stipend of £14,057 (2015/16 rate). There will also be some support available for you to claim for limited conference attendance. The scholarship length will be 3 or 3.5 years, depending on the qualifications and training needs of the successful applicant. 
 Eligibility/Entry Requirements:  We require an enthusiastic graduate with a 1st class degree in Mathematics (or other highly mathematical field such as Physics or Chemistry), preferably at MMath/MSc level, or an equivalent overseas degree (in exceptional circumstances a 2:1 class degree, or equivalent, can be considered).

 Summary   King’s Improvement Science (KIS) ( www.kingsimprovementscience.org ) is a collaboration between King’s College London and its partners in the King’s Health Partners (KHP) Academic Health Sciences Centre—King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. 
 KIS aims to detect and remedy quality gaps in its constituent NHS Trusts and to develop the relatively new field of improvement and implementation science. Via a suite of prestigious three year fellowships, KIS will develop a new cadre of postdoctoral staff who will bridge the clinical-research divide in healthcare improvement. KIS aims to meet the internationally recognised need for researchers of this type, and help to correct a historic imbalance in healthcare research funding away from applied health and social care research. 
 KIS are delighted to offer three postdoctoral fellowships and two senior postdoctoral fellowships all of three years duration to outstanding postdoctoral researchers. The fellows will work on improvement/implementation science research at the King's Health Partners Trusts. Fellowship post holders will be employed by King's College London and receive supervision from senior academic staff at King's College London. We welcome and strongly encourage applications from candidates with experience of using health services for a long-term condition. 
 The post holders will contribute to the development of improvement/implementation science. During the course of the fellowship, the post holders will be expected to publish first author publications in high impact scientific journals and make a significant authorial contribution to others. At the end of the three year fellowships, fellows are expected to have lead their own improvement science research project, contributed significantly to the improvement science knowledge base and to have secured their own grant in improvement/implementation science. 
 Fellowship candidates can apply to work on one of the projects listed on the KIS website (see  www.kingsimprovementscience.org/jobs ), or can propose their own original three year project within the field of improvement/implementation science. 
 Within their application, candidates must clearly indicate their project preference, or state that they wish to make their own proposal and provide a clear outline of this. The outline should provide details of: the project aims, scientific significance in relation to improvement and implementation science, proposed methodology, timescales, plans for dissemination and potential impact. Candidates should explain why they are seeking a career in the field of improvement/implementation science and should describe their suitability for a fellowship with reference to the person specification. 
 It is envisaged that the fellowships will commence in April 2016. 
 Details 
 The closing date for receipt of applications is 11 February 2016. 
 Interviews will be held on during late February/early March 2016.

 Summary: 
 The School of Health and Related Research, fourth in the UK for the power of our health research, is one of the largest and most influential centres in this field. We tackle some of the world’s biggest health challenges to improve the health and care of people in the UK and around the world. 
 The University of Sheffield, through ScHARR, has established the Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected Healthcare (CATCH), with a vision to transform the ways in which people are enabled to live well and age well through the application of ubiquitous and personalised technology. CATCH is a cross-faculty Centre that co-ordinates the input of more than 60 research and clinical scientists from 14 departments and five university faculties with a range of research expertise including healthcare, engineering, psychology and social science. Research areas include complex behavioural interventions, human communication technology, assistive and social robotics and intelligent personalised support, with applications in healthcare, independent living, cognitive and mental wellbeing, and self-managed rehabilitation. Research expertise covers the spectrum from identifying user needs, research for the development of new technologies, user-centred technology design and development, evaluation of new technology-supported interventions in a new innovative ‘home lab’ environment, through to large-scale trials and implementation in practice and in people’s homes. 
 We are now looking to develop this area of work still further and are looking for an outstanding, dynamic research leader. You will demonstrate a track record of internationally leading research in a relevant field of health and related research, and will have a record of success in research funding, publication and impact. You will play a key role in contributing to our strategic aims, building on the existing interdisciplinary activity and expanding our world-class reputation for assistive technology and connected healthcare research. 
 You will provide academic leadership within CATCH and ScHARR in order to energise and motivate staff, and to develop a culture of excellence in research and teaching. You will play a key role in the academic leadership of ScHARR, in the enhancement of the School’s internal and external profile, as well as the further development of its academic plan. 
 You should be enthusiastic, hardworking, well organised and able to prioritise work demands in a challenging academic and professional environment. You will have the ability to think and act strategically and be able to work effectively and collaboratively across disciplines as well as with outside organisations. The post demands a commitment to teamwork, a flexible attitude and an ability to respond positively to the challenges faced by the Centre and the School.

 Applications are invited for the post of Research Fellow in Timbral Modelling, in the Institute of Sound Recording (IoSR), to work on the EU-funded project “Audio Commons: An Ecosystem for Creative Reuse of Audio Content”.The aim of this project is to develop systems and technologies to facilitate the integration of Creative Commons licensed audio content into the workflows of the creative industries, enabling such content to be created, accessed, retrieved and reused in innovative ways. The project will address the creative, technical, legal and business-related challenges presented by this aim. 
 The specific objective of the team with which the Research Fellow will work is to develop a system to timbrally characterise audio (in a non-musical context) such that timbral descriptors can be added to content automatically. 
 The successful applicant will have expertise in psychoacoustics and acoustics, with an understanding of factors likely to be related to timbral perception, and will have completed (or be very close to completion of) a doctoral research degree in a relevant area. Skills in and experience of the following are essential: the design and execution of listening-based elicitation and scaling experiments; statistical analysis and modeling; and programming in one or more of Python, C++ and MATLAB. Also essential are strong writing skills for audiences of varying levels of technical expertise, and the ability to work independently and manage time effectively. Specific skills in timbral modeling would be an advantage, as would experience in semantic profiling of verbal datasets, and academic publications in a relevant area. 
 The timbral modelling element of the Audio Commons project will be led by Dr Tim Brookes and Dr Russell Mason from the University of Surrey’s IoSR, in collaboration with the University’s Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) for some elements of audio feature extraction and with the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) at Queen Mary University of London for system integration. The overall project is led by the Music Technology Group (MTG) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. Surrey’s Centre for the Digital Economy (CoDE) and other commercial partners are also part of the consortium.

 The College wishes to recruit a Research Fellow to support the work of Prof Alastair Hibbins and Prof Roy Sambles. This post, within the Electromagnetic and Acoustic Materials Research Group, is available from 01 March 2016 for 48 months. The group has an excellent track record in delivering successful research projects, training doctoral students (currently hosting the £12m EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training [CDT] in Metamaterials), and collaborating with external partners.  Funded by DSTL, the project will develop the science and technology underpinning the next generation of acoustic metamaterials. It will take ideas from electromagnetism and apply them to acoustics as well as developing fundamentally new concepts for acoustic materials and applications. 
 The role will include experimental, numerical and analytical work, and will likely include the characterisation of novel acoustic materials, matched impedance systems, absorbers and surface waves. He/she will be able to communicate complex information, orally, in writing and electronically and at conferences and seminars.  
 They will be encouraged to prepare proposals and applications to external bodies. The successful applicant will be expected to regularly present information on research progress and outcomes to DSTL. He/she will work as part of a thriving research group, sharing knowledge and understanding with many other researchers including engaging with PhD students within Exeter’s CDT in Metamaterials. 
 Applicants will possess a relevant PhD and have some experience of experimental research. They will be able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge in the discipline, and of research methods and techniques (e.g. FEM modelling) to work within established research programmes.

 Train exterior cleaning is usually conducted by a mechanised washer. However, this washer cleans only the sides of the body well. It does not clean the cab front nose or the body-end panels between carriages well. The train cab front nose often consists of complicated shapes such as curved surfaces, pockets or concaves around the coupler and bumpers, and obstacles (e.g., wipers in the vicinity of the centre headlamp). These lead to a huge amount of manual labour work for exterior body washing, which presents serious health & safety issues due to working with awkward body postures and with water in an environment close to 25kV overhead lines and 750V third rails. 
 This MSc by Research participates in a recently awarded project to study the feasibility of a “Cab Front Cleaning Robot”. Together with our partners (Heriot-Watt University, Bombardier Transportation, Chiltern Railways, and Shadow Robot Company), the MSc student will be looking at the whole systems design as well as mechanical arm design. After building a 1/10 scale model of a train front end, the student will design and develop a prototype of a mechanical arm as well as a cleaning roller. Another student at Heriot-Watt University will look at the controlling aspects.   
 The student will be based at Manufacturing Informatics Centre, Manufacturing Theme, School of Aerospace, Transport and Manufacturing of Cranfield University. 
 Entry requirements: 
 Applicants should have a first or second class UK honours degree or equivalent in a related discipline, such as mechanical engineering. The ideal candidate should have strong competence in machine design, mechanism design, and CAD and CAE tools. The candidate should be self-motivated, have good communication skills for regular interaction with other stakeholders, with an interest for industrial research.

 We are seeking to appoint a talented and highly motivated post-doctoral researcher to join a project entitled ""Sub-national context and radical right support in Europe"" (SCoRE). This is an interdisciplinary European project which aims to provide the first comparative survey of local radical right support in four Western European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). The project will collate all available secondary political and socio-economic data from official sources to establish an across-time database at multiple levels of territorial aggregation, as well as commissioning a large standardised survey across the four countries, to collect an up-to-date set of individual demographic, attitudinal and behavioural indicators. Finally, all the data will be combined in a statistical model of radical right support, identifying the comparative role of contextual and individual attributes. 
 You will support a range of different technical activities including: UK secondary data harvesting and collection; deriving geographical look up tables LUTs, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) point-in-polygon searching/interpolation; calculation of NUTS2/3 and LAU0 indicators, and preliminary descriptive analysis of aggregate secondary data. In the second year of the project, you will also liaise on / carry out preliminary data cleaning and coding in conjunction with other Research Assistants in the other countries, prior to analysis by Principal Investigators. You will undertake some work (as part of the authoring team) on a literature review of the UK country study and work on the information preparation prior to Year 2 symposium. 
 You will have a PhD (or near completion) or equivalent postdoctoral research experience in a relevant social science field (e.g. Geography, Political Science, Sociology, or Social Statistics). Experience of collating and using official UK secondary data sources (e.g. Census, election results, etc.) and tools for harvesting is required. You will also have advanced knowledge and use of Geographical Information Systems. You will also be expected to liaise with the project partners and colleagues in France, Germany, and the Netherlands. The nature of the role means that there will be a requirement for occasional European travel to project meetings and possibly international conference and dissemination events.

 Do you want to apply your knowledge of electronics in a rapidly developing scientific field? Do you want to work closely with scientists and turn their custom-built electronics into robust prototypes? Do you want to help us spin out a scientific instrumentation company that will make specialised low-noise electronics accessible to every research group in the world? 
 The goal of this post is to optimise electronics for readout and control of nanoscale electronic devices. In our academic research into nanoscale physics, we have developed specialised electronic instrumentation whose capabilities far exceed what is available commercially. Potential demand from other researchers is large and increasing, and we need a dedicated engineer to develop a commercial prototype low-noise electronic measurement system. 
 You will design, build, test, and document a prototype system suitable for batch-scale production, working closely with research scientists to characterise the system in experimental settings. If successful, continued involvement in the project via a planned spin-off company may be possible. Given the rapid progress in nanoelectronic devices for sensing, energy applications, and quantum computing, this is a chance to contribute to an important and expanding field of science. 
 You will have a degree and/or several years work experience in electronic engineering or a related field, or a research degree involving a strong electronics element. You will demonstrate expertise in design and testing of analogue electronic circuits; PCB design, assembly, and prototyping; and preparing simple mechanical drawings in CAD. You will be well organised and self-motivated, and able to work both independently and cooperatively at all levels. Good communication skills are essential. Full details are in the job description.

The IPC will provide new routes for non-European Union students to access the transformational higher education programmes of the University of York. The IPC will offer high quality programmes designed, academically led, taught and managed by the University. 
 The IPC will admit its first cohort of students in September 2016. This is an exciting opportunity for outstanding candidates to join the IPC Director and Subject Area Leads in establishing the academic and student experience of the College. 
 You will act as Biology or Physics Coordinator, setting up new modules and developing units, in the first instance, for the Foundation Certificate but you will need to work closely with the Study Skills Tutors to provide Biology/Physics input into the Pre-Masters programme. You will report to the Science Subject Area Lead, with whom you will cooperate in planning programme content and organisation. Each Science programme will be presented twice during the academic year and will run for two or three terms. It is anticipated that in excess of 250 full-time students will be accommodated in the initial year with greater numbers in the future. These students will, from Sept 2017 be accommodated in the University’s brand new £25M Piazza building and the IPC will have two dedicated science labs within this building. Your responsibilities will include materials development, coordinating teams of Tutors, the setting and marking of assessments, in addition to teaching classes and conducting tutorials. 
 Key requirements 
 Undergraduate degree or equivalent in Biology/Physics. 
 PGCE or equivalent postgraduate teaching qualification.

 We are seeking a Research Associate/Fellow with expertise in modelling for a BBSRC-funded project investigating drought tolerance of rice root systems. This full time, fixed term post will be available until 31 March 2019 and will be led by Prof Jonathan Lynch and Dr Leah Band and will be in collaboration with rice researchers and breeders in Thailand and the Philippines. 
 The post holder will be based at the Centre for Plant Integrative Biology, on our Sutton Bonington Campus, an interdisciplinary research centre for addressing fundamental questions in plant science, and will also be affiliated with the Centre for Mathematical Medicine and Biology within the School of Mathematical Sciences. 
 The position is part of a project to improve the drought tolerance of rice by creating a novel ideotype that combines potentially beneficial root traits. The post holder will create a new model to analyse the water, nutrient and carbon dynamics within rice roots and use the model to predict how specific root traits increase rooting depth, water capture, and yield under drought stress. We will evaluate whether the traits are synergistic and consider a range of environmental conditions and rice varieties. The model will be based on the established SimRoot framework, a functional-structural plant-root modelling platform, and will involve developing new modules to describe rice root architectures and soil-water capture. 
 Candidates should have excellent modelling and programming skills and must hold or be very near completion of a PhD (or equivalent) that contains a significant amount of computational or mathematical modelling. Any experience of soil/water biophysics and/or plant science would be an advantage. Given the nature of the project, applicants must also have excellent communication skills, have a strong desire to use modelling to answer fundamental biological questions, and be able to work productively as part of an interdisciplinary team. 
 This full time, fixed term position is available from 1 st  April 2016 (or as soon as possible thereafter) and will run until 31 March 2019.

 Applications are invited for a Research Associate (Postdoc) to work on an exciting project in auditory cognitive neuroscience and neurostimulation at Imperial College London. The successful candidate will join the group of Tobias Reichenbach ( http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/reichenbach ). The project is embedded in The Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies at Imperial College ( http://www.imperial.ac.uk/blast-injury ). 
 The project's goal is to develop efficient complex transcranial current stimulation during auditory training to aid rehabilitation from auditory processing disorder. Auditory processing disorder originates with a compromise to the neural circuits that are responsible for analysing auditory signals. Such damage to the central nervous system can result from head injury that can, in turn, be caused by secondary and tertiary blast injuries. Recent studies have found that the majority of war veterans that were exposed to at least one blast during their deployment have auditory processing disorder. Transcranial current stimulation can increase synaptic plasticity and thus aid rehabilitation from neurological disorders. In this project we will employ novel insights into the mechanisms of speech processing in the brain to develop efficient types of complex spatio-temporal transcranial current stimulation that are paired with speech presentation to aid rehabilitation from auditory processing disorder. 
 Applicants should have a PhD (or equivalent) in neuroscience, engineering, physics or computing with experience in signal processing as well as neurostimulation or -imaging. 
 For an informal discussion please contact Dr Tobias Reichenbach (email:  reichenbach@imperial.ac.uk ; telephone: +44 (0)20 759 46370).

 The Catalyst Fund project at the University of Essex is funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). The Catalyst project provides a unique opportunity to bring together the University’s world leading expertise in data sharing and data analytics in the Data Research Centre with Essex and Suffolk County Council’s strength in policy innovation to address two policy priorities that are of local and national importance: 
 Preventing and managing increasing pressures on public services 
 Building community resilience to encourage communities to help deliver solutions to the challenges faced by the county’s public services 
 This collaboration with both Councils will add value to their ongoing activity, helping them to integrate and manage data, to derive intelligence that will inform the design and implementation of service provision. The University input will be focused on the application of smart analytics in addressing the effective targeting and early intervention necessary to deliver efficient public services and better outcomes for vulnerable people. 
 The Catalyst Fund project Data Analyst will be a member of the Catalyst Fund project team and play a critical role in the successful delivery of various high quality data resources from local government to the external user community. The post holder will play a key role in liaising between Centre staff and the UK Data Service to deliver and deposit high quality data resources. They are therefore at the interface between data production and research with a key role in supporting users and enhancing the usability of the data. 
 While the candidate is not required to be a computer programmer they must have strong technical and data management skills, an understanding of data, the high quality requirements expected for a data set, and how to achieve high quality data through data processing systems and value added enhancements to the data to increase the usability of the data. Experience of using large scale complex data is an advantage. The successful candidate will therefore have not only an understanding of the data processing requirements needed to produce high quality data but also, and most critically, an understanding of the research needs of external researchers and the user community.

You will have, or may be working towards, a PhD in a research area which contributes to the development of our postgraduate programmes, or you will be able to demonstrate significant professional experience in the area. Ideally both. You’ll also need to be an inspiring and engaging communicator, an effective organiser and a skilled networker.

 A vacancy has arisen for a permanent fractional (0.5) Lecturer/Senior Lecturer in the field of Creative Writing, with particular expertise in Fiction and/or Non-Fictional Prose.  
 The successful applicant will be able to contribute to the acclaimed BA in Creative Writing at the University of Northampton, drawing on a strong track record of teaching, lecturing and examining in Fiction/Non-Fictional Prose. The applicant will also be a published author, with a strong record of research outputs achieved to date, and plans for further publications of national and/or international renown.  
 Particular emphasis is placed not only on the distinction of individual outputs, but also the ""impact"" their writings may secure, especially to the wider community and to non-academic audiences. The applicant should be expecting to make a substantial contribution to the REF2020 return for English and Creative Writing at the University of Northampton. 
 A willingness to develop this dynamic and growing academic discipline, including, prospectively, at MA and PhD levels, is also expected. An interest in the broad subject area of literature and the environment would be an additional advantage. 
 Members of staff are encouraged to be proactive in subject and pedagogic research initiatives and there are regular staff development opportunities to ensure curricula retain currency in content and delivery. 
 Further Information 
 The Department of English and Creative Writing has strong links with the creative industries and professions, as well as with other institutions nationally and internationally, and all areas present a high profile and a frequent guest speaker programme to connect with best subject practice. 
 The University is involved with a range of local and regional stakeholders, including the Royal and Derngate Theatre and – a specific Creative Writing initiative - the annual Althorp Literary Festival, of which we are sponsors. In 2013 the University sponsored the appearance of novelist and screenwriter Deborah Moggach, in 2014 the novelist Edward St Aubyn and in 2015 the author, broadcaster and musician the Reverend Richard Coles. Creative Writers from the team also participate in the Festival, offering a number of Fringe events. 
 The BA in Creative Writing at Northampton exists both as a Single Honours and Joint Honours BA provision with a range of other programmes. Its Single Honours programme carefully combines the skills of literary criticism and reading with those of creative expression in all genres. In 2014, we launched the Creative Writing Yearbook, in which all graduates of the programme feature, thus leaving the degree as published authors in an ISBN publication, Red Kite. 
 A regular series of visiting speakers takes place, including in the last three years the American novelist, biographer, memoirist and critic Professor Edmund White (Princeton University); novelist and screenwriter Fay Weldon (Bath Spa University); actress, novelist, radio dramatist, screenwriter and journalist Carole Hayman; biographer and literary author Peter Parker; novelist and critic Philip Hensher (Bath Spa University); comedian, novelist, author and librettist Stewart Lee; novelist Alan Smith; and the former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury

 Although malaria rates have halved in the last 15 years it is still a major killer of children and pregnant women in Africa. IVCC is working to develop and deliver new insecticides to fight malaria and other vector borne diseases, especially important as mosquitoes develop resistance to current insecticides. In partnership with industry, donors and other stakeholders, IVCC is on track to deliver several new insecticides with novel modes of action that will counter future resistance and underpin a global malaria eradication programme. We are also developing with our partners a range of additional vector control tools and solutions to fight malaria and neglected tropical diseases, saving lives, improving health and increasing the prosperity of some of the poorest communities in the world. 
 IVCC is also working with a wide range of vector control stakeholders to accelerate the delivery of these new tools through our involvement in the Innovation to Impact (I2I) project. The NgenIRS project is IVCC’s partnership with UNITAID and other key organisations to make the best and most effective insecticides available and affordable to National Malaria Control Programmes in Africa. 
 We are now seeking an experienced communications professional to drive our communications strategy forward. Reporting to the CEO, the Head of Communications and External Relations will take responsibility for delivering innovative and creative communications that will raise awareness about IVCC’s mission and enhance external relations.

You will also have a demonstrable track record of building meaningful working relationships with people at all levels and from diverse cultures. 
 With a strong background in communications, you must be able to demonstrate a strong track record in developing creative high quality communication materials. Highly motivated, you will be able to consistently deliver creative materials from initial inspiration to final product in a variety of media to tight deadlines without supervision and your writing skills must be of the highest order. 
 The location for this post is Liverpool (UK) and regular international travel will be required.

 The School is seeking to appoint a Research Associate to work as part of a multidisciplinary team including microbiologists, engineers, mathematical modellers and commercial companies to develop three major aspects of bioethanol production, yeast propagation (aerobic), yeast fermentation (anaerobic), and distillation operations with the promise of a paradigm shift in energy efficiency and productivity. 
 The position is funded by the  EPSRC . Exchanges of oxygen and other gases in microbial fermenters are critical for product optimisation and microbial growth yields, yet adequate and controllable gas provision and product extraction often limit commercial fermentations. In this programme, we aim to dramatically improve bioreactor and separator performance by exploiting the most complete understanding to date of how yeast respond at the genetic and physiological levels to changing gas supply. 
 We will implement this understanding through a disruptive microbubble technology. Microbubble injection is envisaged for three bioprocessing units:  (i)  aerobic fermentation for biomass production (exemplar: yeast propagation),  (ii)  anaerobic fermentation (exemplar: yeast ethanol fermentation) and  (iii)  distillation of mixtures of bioliquids (exemplar: ethanol from yeast fermentation). 
 By applying a multidisciplinary approach (molecular biology, applied mathematics, engineering) to data obtained from experimentation and operation from laboratory scale (10s of litres), pilot scale (100s–1000 litres) and full scale (1000s litres), the research project should generate the biological, engineering and systems knowledge required to enhance yeast-based bioethanol production. You will hold a PhD or be close to completing (or equivalent experience) in Mathematics/Engineering/Physics with knowledge of Fluid Mechanics.

 The Role 
 Applications are invited for a research assistantship, as part of a four-year major research project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) which started in February 2014. The post is available from 1 July 2015 for a fixed term until 26 January 2018. 
 The Project 
 The AHRC research grant is supporting a four-year project based at the Institute of English Studies, a member institute of the University of London’s School of Advanced Study. The project is led by Professor Simon Eliot of the Institute of English Studies as principal investigator, with Dr Simon Tanner of the Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London as co-principal investigator. The project is in partnership with the National Archives at Kew, and works closely with the Imperial War Museum, the Mass Observation Archive at Sussex University, and with the BBC archives at Caversham. 
 This ground-breaking project aims to address a glaring gap in the history of twentieth-century Britain. Despite its immortalisation as 'The Ministry of Truth' by George Orwell in his novel 1984, and its important role as the public information authority and publicity agent of the British government during the Second World War, relatively little scholarly research has been done on the Ministry of Information. 
 The project is addressing some of the historical and cultural problems raised by the MOI by using the discipline of publishing history which, for the first time, is being applied systematically to government institutions. 
 The Project is pursuing the following main objectives: 
 To explore the MOI as a Publishing Enterprise from 1939 to 1946.  
 To investigate the MOI as a Communications Network.  
 To study the MOI as a social, political, and cultural institution by assessing its impact on the society in which it operated. 
 The project is currently analysing an extensive array of primary resources and plans to interview as many as possible of those whose lives and opinions were in some way affected by the Ministry’s output. We hope that much of the material collected will be made publicly available in the form of a virtual museum and archive. A public exhibition is also planned. 
 The project’s current website is:  http://www.moidigital.ac.uk/  
 About The Department 
 The Institute of English Studies is an internationally renowned research centre, specialising in the history of the book, manuscript and print studies and textual scholarship. 
 Our activities include providing post-graduate courses; hosting major collaborative research projects; providing essential research training in book history and palaeography; and facilitating scholarly communities in all areas of English studies.

 Summary of Job Purpose and Principal Duties 
 Postdoctoral position in the Laboratory of Professor Dario Alessi FRS-to unravel the role of signalling pathways linked to understanding signal transduction pathways linked to human disease.  
 Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Researcher to work in the laboratory of Dario Alessi to unravel the roles of signalling components that regulate protein phosphorylation or ubiquitylation pathways emerging from the genetic analysis of human disease.  
 The work would focus on analysing highly novel but poorly understood signalling components mutated in human disease implicated in diseases such as neurodegeneration or cancer.  
 The aim of the project will be to undertake research to discover how signal transduction components function and are regulated. It will also be critical to comprehend how mutations in these components cause human disease. It is anticipated that the knowledge gleaned from the successful candidates research could ultimately be exploited to devise improved strategies to treat human disease.  
 The successful applicant will deploy a state-of-the-art blend of biochemical, proteomic, pharmacological and genetic methodologies including CRISPR/CAS9 knock-out and knock-in technology. There would also be strong opportunities for interactions with the six major Pharmaceutical companies supporting the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT see  http://www.ppu.mrc.ac.uk/overview/DSTT.php ) to accelerate the exploitation of discoveries.  
 For informal enquiries please contact Dario Alessi ( d.r.alessi@dundee.ac.uk ). For further details on Alessi laboratory research ( http://www.ppu.mrc.ac.uk/research/?pid=2 ) and publications ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Alessi_dr ) please peruse the indicated website links. 
 MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (PPU):  
 This project will be performed in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (MRC-PPU), based within the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee. The MRC-PPU is one of the world’s most renowned centres for research on protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation ( http://www.ppu.mrc.ac.uk/ ). Many world leading researchers in the field of signal transduction have trained within the MRC-PPU. The major aims of the MRC-PPU are to advance understanding of the role of protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation in cell regulation and human disease, to facilitate the development of drugs to treat diseases caused by abnormalities in phosphorylation, to generate reagents and improve technologies. Another key remit of the MRC-PPU is to train the next generation of scientists who will advance our understanding in this crucial area of medical research. The MRC-PPU is in a beautiful location overlooking the estuary of the River Tay and embedded within the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee which is one of the premier Life Sciences research Centres in the world.  
 Candidate requirements: 
 PhD with outstanding academic track record and at least one first authored publication in an internationally recognised peer-reviewed journal. 
 Strong background in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Signal Transduction would be preferable. 
 Experience and strong interest in signal transduction research and how disruptions of these pathways are linked to human disease. 
 Capable of working in a team, but able to plan and work independently. 
 Excellent communication skills and knowledge of the English language are essential. 
 The candidate should have ambitions to become a future star independent researcher either in academia or the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry. 
 The position is available for 3 years. 
 The position will be on the University of Dundee Grade 7 scale points 29-31 only (£30,434 – £32,277 per annum).

 The Project 
 In recent years, there has been considerable work carried out across the HE sector to gain a better understanding of the differentials in student success according to learner characteristics and background; including age, ethnicity and socio economic status. This is an area of great concern for all universities and many have directed considerable resource into investigating this highly complex issue with a view to improving practice. The University is clear that it has a responsibility to explore this issue in terms of its own activities and practice.  
 Given our commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity (EDI), it is incumbent upon us not just to gain a better understanding of the range of issues that impact student success but to ensure we have effective measures in place to counteract the effect of these issues on student outcomes. We are now launching a two-year pilot project to improve the success rates of students who are at risk of non retention and under performance. This project involves a number of academic schools where we are recruiting school-based project specialists to support this activity. 
 The Person 
 The University is seeking to appoint Project Officers for our EDI project for a fixed term of two years. Educated to Degree level, or equivalent, you will have proven experience of working on a project in a research or administrative capacity.  
 You will be a highly numerate and articulate individual who can see the project through from inception to completion. Highly organised with an ability to plan and manage a complex project you will also have sound analytical skills, and experience of researching, analysing and collating data to support development of the student teaching and learning experience. 
 You will also have excellent interpersonal and communication skills and be able to organise and occasionally contribute to EDI training. 
 The School 
 The School, with slight changes in name, has existed from the earliest days of the University of Kent and is part of the Faculty of Sciences within the University. It offers a number of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in mathematics, statistics, actuarial science and finance. 
 There are strong research groups in Mathematics and Statistics and growing research strength in Actuarial Science. All members of the Mathematics and Statistics groups who were eligible for UoA10 of REF2014 were included in our submission. SMSAS has grown significantly in recent years, has a strong budget position and further growth is foreseen. As part of the planned growth, the University is currently preparing plans for a new building for the SMSAS, which should be ready by 2016/17. There should be a period of further growth in staff numbers over the next few years.

 Funded by Bruker UK and the School of Chemistry, one 3.5 year studentship is available at a level equivalent to standard EPRSC funding (stipend which is currently £13,863 per annum and tuition fees), to start in September 2015 for an  UK candidate  with a strong academic record, an ambition to pursue a research career, a broad interest in physical science, and the interest and commitment to join and contribute to dynamic, collegiate and productive research groups at Edinburgh. The candidate must have a 1 st  (2i exceptionally) degree in chemistry, or possibly physics, an aptitude or strong interest in developing their skills, in one or both of the areas of reaction kinetics and computer programming.  
 Before application, candidates should ensure they satisfy Edinburgh studentship eligibility requirements (see  http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/applying/before  for further details) 
 This ambitious research programme seeks to advance unique NMR hardware development in Edinburgh for reaction mechanism and kinetics, which involve custom-built instruments to allow interfacing of precision stop-flow and quench flow techniques with the NMR instrument. The student will thus contribute towards interfacing of chemical reactors with NMR spectrometers, automation of the monitoring of reaction kinetics, and in particular  customising of existing and the development of novel NMR experiments for this area including data evaluation. 
 The research topics studied contain reaction mechanism and kinetics of reactions that are relatively rapid relative to the normal NMR timescale. This research may have substantial application in industrial process research groups in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialist material sectors. 
 Access will be provided to a range of 400-800 MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes, in the Schools’s central NMR suite, and a specialist 400 MHz instrument configured for reaction monitoring in the Lloyd-Jones laboratories. For details see  http://www.chem.ed.ac.uk/research/facilities/characterisation  and  http://www.lloyd-jones.chem.ed.ac.uk/content/research . The student will also be involved in a range of projects focusing on the automation and evaluation of NMR experiments.   
 The student will spend some time working in the BRUKER UK application labs in Coventry. This project will provide a high-quality training opportunity, as well as offer excellent employment prospects in a range of academic orientations or industries. 
 The candidates should contact Dr. Dusan Uhrin ( dusan.uhrin@ed.ac.uk ) or Prof. Guy Lloyd-Jones, FRS ( guy.lloyd-jones@ed.ac.uk ) for informal enquiries and eventually apply via  http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?r=site/view&id=16&cw_xml .

 Project description 
 With the aid of an existing numerical modelling framework the porject's key objective is to develop a novel bespoke ground penetrating radar antenna desing that can be used to faithfully transmit and receive signals to and from near surface targets. The antenna needs to offer excellent broadband performance with quick ring-down characteristics and minimal interference with unwanted objects often found in challenging complex near surface environments. 
 Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a powerful investigative technique for obtaining accurate information about the location of possible targets buried in the shallow subsurface. The method is of particular relevance in the detection of antipersonnel landmines. 
 Although GPR is a very powerful and versatile tool the complexity of information obtained after a GPR survey often prevents us from obtaining the maximum information contained in the GPR data. This complexity arises not only from the fact that GPR responds to a variety of targets but also because GPR transducers operate in close proximity to the ground which dynamically affects their properties and influence the received signals significantly. To fulfil the potential that GPR has as an investigative tool we need to significantly improve our understanding of GPR operation in varied soil environments and be able to accurately model and predict its response and performance using different antenna designs. 
 The primary objective and challenge of the proposed research work is to design a novel bespoke GPR antenna that can be used to faithfully transmit and receive signals to and from the intended targets offering excellent broadband performance with quick ring-down characteristics and minimal interference with unwanted objects often found in its complex operating environment.  This is an interesting and challenging task, which could result in a step change in our ability to detect targets and reduce false alarm rates. Such GPR antenna design and development has to take into account the details and constrains imposed from the demanding operational environment. 
 The project will benefit directly from an already developed efficient modelling framework that allows us to faithfully model GPR responses when operating in complex environments. It is envisaged that testing of a prototype of the final design of the developed GPR antenna will be done at Dstl. 
 Specific eligibility criteria 
 Experience with MATLAB and/or numerical python and C programming is desirable and familiarity with work in a UNIX computing environment would be an asset as well as any experience in computational electromagnetics. The candidate should be able to demonstrate independence and curiosity and be able to lead the project forward.

 The project: A 4-year PhD studentship is available at Bristol from  September 2015  jointly supervised by Prof Paul May and Dr Neil Fox as part of the  Centre for Doctoral Training  in  Diamond Science and Technology . This project comprises: 
 First 6 months is a taught MSc course studying the theory and practical aspects of Diamond Science & Technology (CDT, Warwick University) 
 3-month miniproject learning about theoretical modelling of defects in diamond (Newcastle University) 
 3-month miniproject studying dopants in diamond using XPS (Aberystwyth University) 
 Final  3 years PhD by research  (Bristol University, diamond lab) 
 Hydrogenated diamond surfaces exhibit negative electron affinity (NEA) as a result of the enhanced surface dipole, which makes extracting electrons from diamond in vacuum relatively easy and efficient. The electrons can be extracted by application of a high electric field (field emission) or heat (thermionic emission), the efficiency of which depends on the magnitude of the NEA. Recent experimental work (Bristol, Arizona State Uni) and theoretical work (Bristol & Newcastle) have shown that diamond terminated with suitable metal-oxides can have NEA values that are significantly higher than those from hydrogen, and that these surfaces can be stable up to 1000K. Such oxides include LiO, MgO, TiO, TaO, VO, and a range of others yet to be tested. Metal-oxide-terminated diamond is an excellent candidate for use in thermionic heat converters for use in solar power generators. Such thermionic converters could be used in parallel with current photovoltaic cells to capture both the visible and IR (heat) portions of the solar spectrum, greatly increasing the efficiency of solar power generation. 
 You will deposit various metal oxides (from the list above or newly developed ones) onto diamond surfaces, and then test the effectiveness of these surfaces as electron emission sources. The experimental work, such as choice of metal-oxide, will be guided by theoretical modelling (initially as a miniproject at Newcastle, but continuing throughout the PhD) and by surface analysis such as SIMS or XPS (initially at Aberystwyth but continuing at Bristol throughout the project). The aim would be identify and study in detail an adsorbate (metal-oxide or otherwise) that would enhance the NEA of a diamond surface, be stable at high temperatures (1000K), give a high electron yield at low temperatures (600K), not degrade with use, and be suitable for use in a commercial thermionic heat convertor. 
 How to apply: There are  TWO  applications, one to the Warwick CDT training programme (see:  http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dst/phd_projects/#ED  for details of how to apply)  and  an online application for this particular Bristol-based PhD project at  http://www.bris.ac.uk/pg-howtoapply .

 The overall aim of this project is to demonstrate novel optical instrumentation for high-resolution inspection and precision measurement of large engineered parts. In order to achieve these aims we will build an array of fibre-optic sources and phase-locked coherent imaging systems to synthesise a large numerical aperture. Additionally, we intend to develop efficient methods to process the recorded information; first to identify regions of interest within the field of view and subsequently to measure imperfections with high-resolution. 
 This project will be carried out as part of the  EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Embedded Intelligence  and is co-sponsored by  NPL and Epigem . 
 Embedded Intelligence is characterised as the ability of a product, process or service to reflect on its own operational performance, usage load, or in relation to the end-user or environment in terms of satisfactory experience. This self-reflection is facilitated by information collected by sensors and processed locally or remotely to derive insight. These aspects must be considered from the design stage such as to enhance product lifetime and performance, increase quality of process or service delivery, or ensure customer satisfaction and market acceptance. 
 This Centre, in collaboration with NPL and Epigem, offers an attractive package, including a  tax free stipend  of up to £17k pa, in addition to  full University PhD registration fees  (£4k pa) for British and EU candidates. Overseas applicants are expected to finance the residual annual PhD fees which are in excess of the home student fees, which accounts to £14k pa. Additionally, there is a generous  personal development budget  of £10k for the specific training needs of the successful candidate. The Centre offers a  unique 4-year Ph.D. programme , drawing on expertise in postgraduate teaching and research supervision in the fields of sensors, system design, embedded software and systems, manufacturing systems, novel manufacturing processing, applications engineering and systems services. The PhD candidate will be supported by the  state-of-the-art facilities  at Renishaw Plc and Loughborough University. 
 A high calibre candidate with first or upper second class (2:1) degree in electronic/systems/mechanical/optical engineering or physics is sought. It is expected that the candidate would have good experimental and computational skills, some knowledge of optics and electronics and a strong interest in optical instrument development with a view towards product development and commercialization.

 University of Nottingham  – Laboratory of Urban Complexity and Sustainability (LUCAS) 
 This is an exciting opportunity to join LUCAS, to contribute to the research programme supported by the prestigious Leverhulme Research Programme Grant “Sustaining Urban Habitats: An Interdisciplinary Approach”. The ambitious aim of this programme is to transform our understanding of how sustainable cities, and by extension our species (given that we are now mainly an urban species), can be. Our objectives are: 
 Understand  the complex interrelated and competing factors influencing urban sustainability. 
 Holistically  define, measure and model  urban sustainability. 
 Identify  pathways  to  transition  developed cities and accommodate  growth  in developing cities in minimally unsustainable ways. 
 Define  policy and governance structures  to implement these pathways in practice. 
 Six inter-related themes have been developed to address these objectives, including the  data theme  which focusses on the collection, management, integration and transformation of data to support the characterisation and modelling of city sustainability. 
 This will require the integration and transformation of data from heterogeneous resources and the subsequent enhancement and representation of this data as information which can feed directly into integrated physical, environmental and socio-economic models. No limit is placed on the type and nature of the data; which may be formal (data from National Mapping and other government agencies), informal (crowd sourced data, or transformations of data from open data platforms (e.g. 3d models from Flickr data) or transformation from sensor data). 
 Within this landscape, applications are invited for a PhD studentship in  3D city model creation and semantic enrichment.  3D urban models are an abstracted 3D representation of the elements that comprise the urban fabric (terrain, buildings, streets, vegetation), enriched with semantic detail to reflect domain requirements. These models are widely used to support visualisation, but their use to support simulations of urban climate, land use, building and transport energy use etc is in its infancy. Specific semantics will be developed that address city-scale planning and simulation requirements. This may include the development of new or contributions to emerging Application Domain Extensions for CityGML. 
 Requirements 
 Preferred candidates should have, or expect to obtain, a first-class or good 2:1 honours degree and / or a distinction or high merit at MSc level in a relevant subject area (e.g. computer science, geography, geoinformatics, engineering or a cognate discipline). Experience in one or more of the following is essential: Geographical information science, 3D modelling, semantic enrichment, remote sensing, database development, scripting. 
 Good communication skills, and the ability to work as part of a team as well as independently are also essential. A willingness to travel within Europe and to China is desirable. 
 The studentship will cover PhD tuition fees for UK/EU students, due to funding restrictions, plus a tax free stipend for three years of  £13,863  per annum. 
 Informal enquiries prior to making an application may be addressed to Dr. Doreen Boyd, email:  doreen.boyd@nottingham.ac.uk  or to Dr. Anthony Beck  anthony.beck@nottingham.ac.uk . To apply, please email a covering letter stating why you wish to apply for and how you fulfill the requirements of this studentship.

 We invite you to apply for a fully funded PhD studentship in gaze informatics. 
 The Interactive Systems research group at Lancaster is developing gaze informatics as a novel research field, concerned with all facets of human eye movements and how they can be embraced for interaction and application in ubiquitous computing. We investigate eye movements as both a source of information and a form of human expression, develop methods to interface and analyse eye movements, and design interaction techniques and applications that leverage eye gaze. We develop our research in the context of ubiquitous computing, considering eye tracking in everyday environments and on pervasive scale, with digital devices of different form and size, and for purposes from fun and games to health and assisted living. 
 The PhD studentship will be for research in any of the following (or similar) areas: 
 The pursuit eye movements that occur when we follow a moving object with our gaze: developing pursuit tracking and calibration methods, investigating human performance in gaze interaction with moving targets, and analysing the affordances of pursuits for the design of natural user interfaces. 
 Social gaze signals and mechanisms, such as following another person’s gaze for joint attention: exploring social and affective aspects of gaze and developing design frameworks for social gaze in human-computer interaction, collaborative applications, and socially engaging user experiences. 
 Eye tracking as a pervasive sensor: investigating ambient modes of eye-tracking where the technology operates in the background of everyday activity, for example for assisted living, and developing methods for context inference from eye movement and user modelling based on gaze analytics. 
 Gaze and gameplay: integrating eye-tracking with gaming platforms, developing conceptual frameworks for gaze in games, and designing novel game mechanics and playful experiences enabled by eye-tracking and gaze. 
 Eye tracking for pervasive health monitoring: understanding links between eye movement and health, developing relevant methods for eye movement and visual behaviour analysis, and investigating embedded assessment, where data is collected and analysed in the context of everyday routines.  
 You should have a master’s degree in Computer Science or related field, and technical competence in human-computer interaction (HCI), sensors and data fusion, computer vision and machine learning, and in working across the hardware and software of pervasive devices. The proposed research is adventurous and above all requires passion and creativity, and a strong motivation to help push the boundaries of knowledge and technology across eye tracking and computing. Results from this research will likely generate considerable interest and travel funds are available for you to engage with the wider research community internationally.   
 Lancaster's School of Computing and Communications offers a stimulating environment for research training of over 120 PhD students. You will join an exciting research group that has a great team ethos, and receive strong support for the development of your research skills and profile. 
 You can apply online at:  www.postgraduate.lancs.ac.uk . The closing date for application complete with supporting documentation (academic transcripts, references, CV and short research proposal) is 15 July 2015.

   Faculty of Engineering – Division of Materials, Mechanics and Structures 
 Creep Fracture Mechanics Approach Applied to Heterogeneous Components with Cracks 
 
 Applications are invited for a fully funded PhD studentship (3 years) to work within the Materials, Mechanics and Structures Research Division within the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Nottingham. 
 Project Background 
 For homogeneous components containing cracks the stress state in the vicinity of the crack can be characterised by the stress conditions and the C* parameter for stationary state creep conditions. The C* parameter is conveniently obtained for a Norton creep material from the C*-contour-integral. Any contour can be chosen, to obtain the C*-contour-integral, because the numerical value of the contour integral is path independent. 
 The C* parameter can be obtained from the results of finite element analyses. 
 For heterogeneous components, such as welded pipes, which have several material zones, i.e. weld material (WM), parent material (PM) and heat-affected-zone (HAZ) material. C*-contour-integrals are found to be path dependent and depend on the crack location as well as crack orientation. 
 This aspect of the creep behaviour of a heterogeneous component makes the creep fracture mechanics (C*) method difficult to apply in practical situations. 
 The aim of this project is to review the assumptions made in the HRR (Hutchinson, Rice and Rosengren) mathematical solution for C* and to see whether there are situations in which the C* method can be expected to apply for heterogeneous components. It is also important to determine the conditions under which the C* method would not be expected to work. 
 The project is intended to be a mixture of analytical, computational and finite element methods but additional experimental information can be obtained as part of the project, if necessary. 
 Studentship Information 
 The studentship is expected to start on 1 st  October 2015 and will cover PhD tuition fees (for UK students, EU students who have been ordinarily resident in the UK for the preceding 3 years and exceptional EU students) and a tax free stipend for three years (£13,833 per annum). An additional £2000 a year may be awarded for students with a 1st class degree / MSc Distinction from a UK Russell Group University or equivalent. 
 Students must have a 1 st  or 2:1 class academic qualification in an Engineering related subject. A Masters degree in a similar discipline and/or experience in high temperature materials will be an advantage. 
 To make an application, please send a covering letter stating clearly how you fulfil the requirements of the studentship, your research interests and include a CV, academic transcripts and the names and addresses of two academic referees, to  Christopher.Hyde@nottingham.ac.uk .

 Microfluidic Single-Cell Arrays for Stem Cell Heterogeneity Studies 
 In recent years an unexpected degree of variation in the response of genetically identical cells to biochemical signals has been discovered, which is highly relevant for stem cell research in general and regenerative medicine in particular. Traditional bulk assays do not give useful information because they present a read-out that is the average of many different cells. Heterogeneous cell populations should hence be studied at the single-cell level, preferably in a high-throughput format that can address many individual cells simultaneously. 
 This PhD project concerns the development of microfluidic cell arrays, where hundreds of cells are individually positioned by hydrodynamic forces, for the characterization of signalling heterogeneity in populations of mesenchymal stem cells. The project will seek to determine heterogeneity in the response to agents, delivered to the stem cells by nanoparticles, that can guide stem cell differentiation for regenerative medicine strategies. 
 The PhD student will fabricate the cell traps with established soft lithography methods, will manipulate the cell samples and optimize their on-chip arraying, and will analyze the optical microscopy data with semi-automated image processing methods. We are thus looking for an engineer with a strong interest in biomedical applications or for a biochemist/biomedical scientist with an affinity for bioengineering approaches. 
 You will work on the microfluidic cell arrays in a large interdisciplinary research group - Hybrid Biodevices ( http://www.southampton.ac.uk/ifls/research/ifls/hybridbiodevices.page ) - that operates at the interface between the Life Sciences and Electronic Engineering, and you will work on the stem cell cultures in the Centre for Human Development, Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine ( http://www.southampton.ac.uk/chdscr/ ), under the supervision of Dr Maurits de Planque (Electronics and Computer Science -  http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/mdp ) and Dr Nick Evans (Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Engineering - http://www.southampton.ac.uk/medicine/about/staff/ndevans.page ). 
 Southampton's School of Electronics and Computer Science is one of the foremost Electronics and Electrical Engineering departments in the UK (see  http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/about ) with a strong commitment to research at the Life Sciences Interface through the Institute for Life Sciences ( http://www.southampton.ac.uk/ifls/ ), which also encapsulates the Bioengineering research of the Faculties of Medicine and Engineering 
 Please note that the studentship associated with this project is currently only part funded.

 We seek to appoint a talented and ambitious epidemiologist to join a new interdisciplinary research programme in population health and genomics funded as part of the £4m National Institute of Health Research Blood and Transplant Research Unit in Donor Health and Genomics based at the University of Cambridge, supported by funds from the NIHR, the British Heart Foundation and the University of Cambridge. Candidates will work across world-leading institutes in population health sciences and genomics, and gain direct experience of NHS Blood and Transplant, an innovative high-throughput component of the National Health Service. 
 The successful candidate will coordinate and implement analyses to help determine the causal health consequences of blood donation (and the risk factors for these health outcomes) to lay foundations for novel prevention strategies. This will be achieved through analysis of INTERVAL trial data, genetic studies of causality (""Mendelian randomisation""), and large cohort studies enabled by linkage of donor records to health outcomes data in electronic records. It is expected that the post-holder will develop and lead projects that involve analyses of the causal impact of donation intensity and iron stores on specific health outcomes, in a portfolio of studies involving large epidemiological databases. Such analyses will provide internationally unique and unusually detailed insights into the relevance of risk factors to blood donor health, providing important evidence for prevention strategies and public health policy. The role will involve coordinating work to achieve a series of high-impact publications. 
 The post-holder will have: (1) relevant epidemiological qualifications (eg, Masters or PhD in Epidemiology, Public Health) or equivalent experience, (2) a sound understanding of epidemiological concepts (3) experience of manipulating and managing  large datasets (4) strong quantitative (in silico) analysis skills; (5) experience of statistical method development; (6) and experience using relevant statistical software: Stata or R. . The post-holder should also be able to work independently, accurately judge priorities, and have excellent organisational and communication skills.  
 The post holder will work closely with Dr Emanuele Di Angelantonio as well as an interdisciplinary team of scientists, bioinformaticians and statisticians at the CEU and scientific collaborators based in other institutions.

 Title: The impact of adherence to guidelines, individual behaviour, and personality traits on the management of type 2 diabetes. 
 Supervisors: Dr Silviya Nikolova, Professor C Hulme 
 A full time PhD studentship is available for immediate start for UK and EU citizens only. The studentship will attract an annual tax-free stipend of £14,057 for up to 3 years, subject to satisfactory progress and will cover the UK/EU tuition fees. 
 You should hold a first degree equivalent to at least a UK upper second class honours degree in a relevant subject and a master’s degree in an economics/statistics-related research field such as economics, health economics, statistics. This project would suit a student with experience in, or a high level of knowledge about, the analysis of large data sets within the UK or EU. 
 Candidate whose first language is not English must provide evidence that their English language is sufficient to meet the specific demands of their study, the Faculty minimum requirements are: 
 British Council IELTS - score of 6.5 overall, with no element less than 6.0 
 TOEFL iBT - overall score of 92 with the listening and reading element no less than 21, writing element no less than 22 and the speaking element no less than 23. 
 Research Project: 
 This project, which will explore diabetes management, comprises of three distinct novel work packages: 
 1) an exploration of how level of adherence to guidelines impacts upon hospitalisations and length of stay in relation to complications of diabetes, 
 2) an analysis of the impact of individual behaviour on diabetes outcomes, and 
 3) an examination of the impact of personality traits on these behaviours. 
 The projects will use a number of different statistical and econometric modelling methods. All projects will use the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). ELSA, which began in 2002, is a household longitudinal survey dataset for the study of health, economic position, and quality of life among a representative sample of people over the age of 50. This is optimal given that type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older individuals. ELSA is also unique in collecting the behavioural information needed for the analysis of provider compliance, individual choice, and personality traits with regards to type 2 diabetes management, making it preferable to the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), a large randomised trial with 5102 patients, which collects no such data. There are in total 5269 individuals with diagnosed diabetes in the five waves of ELSA (ELSA Wave 5, 2010). 
 How to apply: 
 To apply for this studentship applicants should send a personal statement together with a CV (including the details of 2 academic referees), degree transcripts and degree certificates to the Faculty of Medicine and Health Graduate School –  fmhgrad@leeds.ac.uk . Any queries regarding the application process should be directed to  fmhgrad@leeds.ac.uk .

 Research in the School of Science and Technology’s multidisciplinary Materials and Engineering Research Unit is extremely strong in terms of high quality outputs, funding income, and international impacts. This Research Unit includes staff working across the Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering and Technology academic disciplines. 
 In the recent REF2014 assessment ( http://www.ref.ac.uk/ ) of the quality of research at all UK Universities our Research Unit’s submission to UoA B15 was highly rated, having 84% of overall activity at the highest 3* (internationally excellent) and 4* (world-leading) grades. This included achieving an impressive ranking of joint 7th out of 62 submitted institutions (Times Higher) for the quality of our publications which were judged as attaining 94.6% at 3* and 4* levels. 
 Our aim is to appoint an outstanding individual with leading edge research within a field that complements the activities of our multi-disciplinary Materials and Engineering Research Unit. Our current areas of research excellence in Imaging include OCT, MRI, remote spectral imaging, and Focal Construct X-Ray Imaging with materials discrimination. Other examples of research areas that would be of interest include: (1) Advanced Imaging or Sensing Science, methods and techniques; (2) Applications crossing disciplines, for example in Art/Heritage, Neuroimaging/Biosciences/Medical, Machine Vision, Materials Analysis, Security; (3) Imaging and Sensing devices and/or related and underpinning materials, synthesis and fabrication technologies; (4) Underpinning Theory and/or Modelling relating to Imaging or Sensing (e.g. in electromagnetism, wavefront manipulation, imaging devices and materials modelling). 
 We are seeking an exceptional individual who will engage in internationally excellent or internationally leading research in Imaging or Sensing, and which would fall within the scope of the REF2014 UoA B15 descriptor. Research into the solution of generic problems encountered in image processing, computer vision or graphics is unlikely to fall within this scope.

 QBF-solvers are powerful tools that efficiently tackle the classically hard problem of solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) for important industrial applications, including verification and planning. In this project we aim to advance the understanding of the power and limitations of QBF algorithms. The main theoretical approach for this is through proof complexity, as the complexity of proofs directly corresponds to the complexity of QBF-solvers. QBF proof complexity is a young field with an exciting development in recent years. However, major questions remain open, including designing proof systems for solvers, developing techniques for lower bounds and finding hard formulas.

 Applications are invited for a fully-funded 3 year Ph.D. studentship on the theme described below, as part of the Communications Research Group. 
 Details 
 Several technologies exist for identifying the location of a transmitting node indoors. These vary from extremely precise, physically large and power-demanding (e.g. Ultra-Wideband systems), to low cost and low complexity, general approximate presence detection (e.g Bluetooth Smart beacons). There are also research-grade implementations of signal processing algorithms, such as MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification). 
 As an example application, there is a commercial need in Social Care Systems to quickly identify the location of a patient in one of two scenarios, in an unobtrusive and cost-effective way: 
 In which indoor room is the patient? (e.g. in a multi-room, care facility) 
 Is the patient indoor or outdoor? (i.e. does the attending emergency service need to break down the front door or go into the back garden) 
 The University is working with Tunstall Healthcare Ltd who operates in this business area. 
 Two differing radio technology techniques have been devised, that require further research. Both use a combination of novel yet low-cost RF hardware, combined with DSP to process the initial radio signals from the patient’s node, as detected by multiple local base stations. These processed signals could then to be used, for example, in a Cloud-based expert system employing signal pattern matching against a database, to identify the location of the patient. 
 The purpose of this research project is to first understand the limitations of the two concept systems so far investigated and then select a relevant topic to investigate further, ideally leading to a new technology demonstrator based on one of the existing concepts. The research topic could be from one or more of (but not limited to):- 
 Novel and low resource DSP algorithms for the multiple base station RF signal detection, as associated with angle of arrival or received signal power level assessment 
 Novel RF hardware for the patient node and Base station (including antenna design), possibly including wearable technology for the patient node. 
 Signal pattern matching techniques for application to the multiple base station concept, including techniques to minimise initial pattern matcher training and subsequent re-training. 
 Researchers can expect to become involved in designing hardware and software for their proposed system(s) and then trialling them in real world scenarios. The expectation is that the researcher’s project will contribute to a positioning technology test bed, focused on the Social Care application.

 Area of Research 
 Computational Biological Chemistry, Drug Design, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs 
 Project Description 
 This project is based in the computational biological chemistry research group of Dr Stefan Erhardt. The interactions of small molecules with enzymes will be investigated. Inhibition mechanisms of known drugs are studied to gain deeper insight into their mode of action and to develop novel more potent inhibitors with potentially less side effects.  
 The long-term usage of ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can lead to gastric adverse effects. On the other hand some drugs which were prescribed in the past could lead to a higher heart attack risk. Particularly patients who suffer from arthritis would benefit from the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs. However, recent studies have also indicated the importance of NSAIDs in the prevention and treatment of cancer. 
 The results of computational study will be used to synthesise novel compounds and then test their biological activity. 
 Computational modelling techniques such as molecular docking, density functional theory, molecular dynamic and QM/MM calculations will be employed. No prior knowledge of computational biology is required. A strong biochemical background would be beneficial. Applicants must have an undergraduate degree in a relevant discipline. 
 Contact Dr Stefan Erhardt ( S.Erhardt@napier.ac.uk ) for more information.

 Mast syndrome is an inherited upper motor neurone disease associated with a rapidly-progressing form of dementia and belongs to a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases; the hereditary spastic paraplegias. Due to a lack of understanding of the biological basis of these and related neurodegenerative conditions, there is currently no treatment available. Our group has a long track record in the investigation of these conditions, and has previously discovered 11 new genetic causes of these conditions, including Mast syndrome shown to be due to mutation of the ACP33 gene. Little is known about the function of ACP33 protein, although some molecular evidence suggests it may regulate axonal branching, and protein modelling suggests it binds lipids. We hypothesise that ACP33 acts as a molecular chaperone shuttling lipids throughout the elaborate, neuronal morphology. 
 A major barrier to studying lipid function is the difficulty labelling and visualising them. Fluorescent reporters can map localisation but may mask endogenous interactions and induce side-effects. SRS microscopy circumvents these issues by providing label-free, chemically-specific, quantitative imaging of chemical species distribution within a cell based on vibrational spectroscopy. 
 Understanding the biological basis of the dysfunctional lipid metabolism common to many neurological conditions offers an important new way to treat these devastating disorders. This unique combination of biophysics and 4-D image analysis applied to a genetic disorder will shed new light on the underlying pathology of Mast syndrome and provide invaluable insights for broader application to other related neurodegenerative conditions.

 This project is one of a number which are funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Doctoral Training Partnership to commence in September 2016. The studentships will provide funding for a stipend (currently £14,057 per annum for 2015/16), research costs of £3,000 and UK/EU tuition fees at Research Council rates for 3.5 years. 
 The physical properties of cell plasma membrane, such as elasticity and electrostatic potentials, have been increasingly recognised for their importance in controlling cell biological function. In this project, we will investigate how the physical properties of the membrane of red blood cells affect biochemical signalling recently established to originate from the cell plasma membrane. The first part of the project will be dedicated to developing and implementing of novel experimental techniques for quantification of membrane elastic constants in an unambiguous manner. This work will be carried out in close collaboration with theoreticians and computational physicists in order to develop novel computational framework for the interpretation of the experimental measurements. Once established, these methods will be used to investigate the factors affecting the release of biochemical signalling agents known to occur upon deforming the red cell membrane. We will also seek to establish how abnormal conditions akin to disease such as elevated oxidative stress levels and/or glycation affect the production and release of signalling agents and regulators of vascular function. These studies will provide better understanding of the role the red cell membrane properties play in regulating vascular tone and haemodynamics, and suggest new ways for ameliorative interventions in disease.

 Physical activity (PA) is associated with physiological and psycho-social health benefits but ~33% of children are not sufficiently active. Fundamental to such conclusions is the accurate and reliable measurement of habitual PA. However, poor adherence to wearing monitors and/or a novelty effect, resulting in atypical PA patterns, confound previous studies. This study aims to develop a low power and cost, ubiquitous, wrist-worn device with embedded microcontroller and wireless communication modules incorporated within a fashionable watch that automatically syncs with a cloud-based hub, reducing participant burden and thus improving adherence and data quality. The aim is to produce a device which participants choose to wear constantly for a long time, thereby enabling the first longitudinal and ecologically valid insight into true PA levels. We propose 6 phases: 1) Investigation of suitable hardware and software components; 2) device design/development; 3) device evaluation through user-groups; 4) device refinement; 5) data processing algorithm development for remote analysis and 6) production of a final device for feasibility and efficacy testing.

 Applications are invited for a PhD studentship with integrated studies as part of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Fuel Cells and their Fuels to start in October 2016. The project will be based mainly in the Department of Chemical Engineering/School of Aeronautical, Automotive, Chemical and Materials Engineering, Loughborough University, together with some parts to be based in the School of Chemistry, at the University of Nottingham.   
 Primary Supervisor: Prof. Wen-Feng Lin 
 Secondary supervisors: Prof. Rui Chen, and Prof. Darren Walsh (the University of Nottingham) 
 Project Detail: 
 The project aims to develop highly efficient low temperature fuel-flexible Fuel Cell technology capable of operating directly on liquid alcohol fuels with an emphasis on ethanol from bio-feedstocks. The project will use, and build upon, recent results both from the partners and from external sources to determine the firstly the fundamentals of ethanol oxidation and this new information will be used to design new practical catalytic materials (anode and cathode) capable of fully oxidizing ethanol to carbon dioxide, achieving maximum 12 electrons per fuel molecule at anode and to eliminate fuel crossover poisoning the cathode.

 Overview 
 This project will focus on  ‘the role of retrotransposons in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)’. 
 Cancer is a genetic disease resulting from accumulation of mutations and associated genetic instability in cells. HCC is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide, owing to a lack of understanding of the key factors driving its progression, as well as limited treatment options.  Recently retrotransposons have received much attention in the field of cancer and have been demonstrated to be active in various tissues including liver, colon, ovarian, prostate and lung cancer. Contribution of active retrotransposons in increasing genetic instability and overall transcriptome of cells is well documented.  We hypothesise that activation of retrotransposons can be used as an early biomarker of HCC and they can prove as important therapeutic targets for control and management of HCC. The student will characterise relationships between levels of retrotransposons activation and HCC tumour grade, stage and outcome in human subjects and animal models of HCC. The student will also explore the mechanisms of activation of retrotransposons in HCC and impact of inhibition of retrotransposons activation on HCC outcome or progression. 
 The project will provide a broad grounding in contemporary techniques relevant to basic and translational cancer research, becoming familiar with the development and validation of targeted anti-cancer therapy. He/she will be trained by experienced personnel in cell culture, tumour and tissue handling, protein extraction and purification, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, FACS, gene-editing and gene expression analyses. Training will also be given in data handling, processing, interpretation and statistical analyses.

 This project will use signal processing and pattern recognition methods to deliver a novel, clinically valid application (App) to automate measures important in the quantification of upper limb function in Huntington’s Disease (HD). Our group has recently developed the Moneybox test (MBT); a standardized assessment of bilateral, upper motor function. Uniquely, this has been developed in accordance with translational neuroscience and physiological principles, aiming to tackle the lack of quantitative and functional outcome measures available for people with Huntington Disease (HD).   
 This study will allow quantification of abnormal movement throughout the MBT, using novel and affordable technology. The proposed project will last 9 months and comprise 3 stages. In stage 1 (months 1-3), we will develop signal processing algorithms and software to quantify the movement signatures seen during the performance of the MBT in a cohort of already available data in HD (n=60) and healthy controls (n=15). In stage 2 (months 4-6), we will test the developed software in a cohort of 10 healthy volunteers leading to an optimised and validated version of the proposed algorithm. In Stage 3 (months 7-9), we will develop a readily available App to quantify critical parameters influencing upper limb function in HD and test this in a cohort of 10 HD patients. Results will be available in a variety of interfaces   The project is led by Prof Monica Busse Morris in the School of Healthcare Sciences with Prof Cathy Holt and Dr Yulia Hicks in the School of Engineering and Prof Anne Rosser in the School of Medicine.  The post will be managed in the School of Engineering with technical supervision from Prof Holt/Dr Hicks. To ensure important clinical translation, there will be close supervision also from Profs Busse Morris and Rosser.  This position is fixed term for 9 months starting 1st March 2016.    Please be aware that Cardiff University reserves the right to close this vacancy early should sufficient applications be received.   Cardiff University is committed to supporting and promoting equality and diversity. Our Inclusive environment welcomes applications from talented people from diverse backgrounds.  For this vacancy we particularly welcome applications from females who are under-represented in this field. We will also consider proposals for flexible working or job share opportunities.

 Project Theme:   Fluid Dynamics 
 Aircraft noise is one of the most important impacts that air traffic has on our environment. The noise at take-off and landing is largely due to the turbulent wake of the landing gear. This project involves developing new methods to predict and eliminate this noise. The work will involve extending recent developments in the low-order modelling turbulent boundary layers to complex geometries such as landing gear. It will also involve designing and optimising noise mitigation strategies within this new framework. The end result will be a new methodology for the design and control of noise for a wide range of applications. 
 Prospective applicants should have a first class honours degree in an Engineering subject, Applied Mathematics, Physics or similar discipline and must be able to demonstrate a strong mathematical aptitude. Programming experience (C++, python, Matlab etc) would be a strong advantage.

 Project Description: 
 The Centre for Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics at Exeter is one of the leading research groups of its kind in the UK. Our research encompasses the Fluid Dynamics of Weather and Climate, Theoretical Fluid Dynamics, Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics, Solar-Terrestrial Plasmas and Space Weather. We invite applications to study for a fully-funded PhD starting in Sept 2016. 
 This project will investigate the mathematics and physics of magnetic helicity transport. Applications will include plasma physics (helicity transport and decay in laboratory devices) and space physics (the atmosphere of the sun and the heliosphere). 
 Helicity integrals measure geometric and topological properties of a magnetic field such as twisting, writhing, and linking of field lines. While they are readily calculated in volumes with planar or spherical boundaries, other volumes of interest (e.g. cubes, tori, hemispheres) present interesting complications. Using tools from differential geometry such as the Gauss Bonnet theorem, we will develop computer codes for calculating helicity in these volumes. One applications lies in finding the net helicity flow into each hemisphere of the sun and heliosphere, taking advantage of recent and upcoming observations (e.g. SoHO, SDO, STEREO and Cluster). The expressions for helicity flow through boundaries can be employed in analysing vortex motion on surfaces.

 Injuries are one of the greatest concerns for athlete health (Drawer & Fuller, 2001). Injuries have been shown to have not only serious physical consequences for athletes but also numerous psychological implications (Brewer, 2007). Severe injuries are particularly prevalent in elite female football, with most injuries occurring to the lower extremity and of which there is a far greater (x4-5) incidence of knee ligament sprains than male players (Nilstad et al 2014). This has important consequences on player availability and team performance but also on the long term health of players, osteoarthritis risk and quality of life. The fatigue that occurs during football matches can result in a decline in physical and cognitive performance (Patterson and Gray 2007; Foskett et al 2008) and these performance decrements have typically been the focus of previous research projects. But, there is also evidence that fatigue affects injury risk factors, such as hamstring strength and balance (Delextrat et al 2013).  This study will further our understanding of fatigue on injury risk and injury prevention in elite female football players. 
 The successful candidate is expected to start their studies in July 2016.

 People often do not take up programmes or interventions, even if these might have high returns or improve their wellbeing. Psychological constraints may form part of an explanation for this pattern. These psychological constraints may be particularly severe among poor people in low-income countries.  
 Kate Orkin and Stefan Dercon are collaborating with economists and psychologists from Princeton and Duke Universities, the University of Cape Town and IFPRI to build a large-scale programme of research in this area. Research will examine (1) if psychological interventions can alter poor people’s subjective expectations, sense of their capabilities and preferences in developing world contexts; (2) whether these changes alter economic behaviour and outcomes; and (3) whether integrating psychological interventions into existing anti-poverty programmes enhances the effect of these programmes. 
 This is a fixed-term post for 2 years, based at the CSAE, Blavatnik School of Government. Applicants must have been awarded, or are nearing completion of, a doctoral degree in a relevant discipline. Main duties include managing a large RCT; contributing to and/or collaborating on other research projects and engaging in original, world-class research in an area relevant to this programme; and managing a small group of research assistants. Applicants must demonstrate evidence of developing a track record of publications; the ability to carry out independent quantitative research; and experience working in developing countries. Previous experience in designing and conducting lab and/or field experiments is desirable. 
 The post provides an opportunity for an ambitious researcher in development economics to gain valuable research, project management and field experience and go on to an independent research career. Many previous Oxford postdoctoral fellows have moved on to permanent faculty positions at leading universities in the US, Europe and Asia. 
 The closing date for applications is 12.00 noon on 20 June 2016.

 Despite the significant advances in the capability and availability of computational platforms and techniques across society, the technological systems of today are still highly visible and intrusive to the individuals who use them. 
 The School of Computer Science at Manchester has defined a grand challenge to investigate the techniques, technologies and architecture platforms that are required to enable ubiquitous computing to play a transformative role in society. 
 The associated open issues and opportunities will cover research and innovation across a broad front, from devices, sensors and wearable devices, through secure data integration and analysis, to the computing and storage paradigms, architectures, micro-architectures and associated technologies needed to deliver the capabilities and services required in a technological integrated society. 
 To provide the extra impetus required to address the challenges above, the school has invested in three new academic positions, to complement, and establish new collaborations between, existing areas of strength within the school. 
 Future ubiquitous computing systems will require new computing architectures (including FPGAs), systems and technologies, ranging from the requirements for interfacing with the sensor, to the machines capable of storing, accessing and manipulating complex data of lifelong records across entire populations. As a result, we are interested to receive applications in the area of computer system architectures, runtimes and the numerous aspects of hardware design as well as interests associated in the privacy and security solutions for such systems. 
 You should be educated to PhD level, have an excellent publication record, show capability of developing a portfolio of funded research activities in a multidisciplinary environment, and have a strong commitment to excellence in teaching. Applications from candidates with a relevant computer systems architecture focused industrial career are welcomed. 
 The School of Computer Science is committed to promoting equality and diversity, including the Athena SWAN charter for promoting women’s careers in STEMM subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine) in higher education. The School received a Bronze Award in 2013 for their commitment to the representation of women in the workplace and we particularly welcome applications from women for this post.

 The London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease Research (LCNTDR) was founded in 2012 with Professor Sir Roy Anderson as Director. Its mission is to be an international resource and centre of excellence for research on the epidemiological analysis and modelling of the transmission and control of neglected tropical diseases. The Centre is built upon world-leading research in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology (DIDE) at Imperial College London on infectious disease transmission, evolution and control. It provides research support to control implementation agencies, and undertakes applied collaborative work with national and international agencies plus philanthropic organisations in support of health policy planning and disease control programmes to control neglected tropical diseases in Africa, South America and Asia.  
 This post is funded by a major Gates Foundation grant entitled Deworm3, with operational centres at the Natural History Museum (part of LCNTDR) and the University of Washington in Seattle USA, to develop analytical techniques in support of clinical trials of the optimal designs for mass drug administration programmes to stop parasite transmission in endemic regions in Africa, India and South East Asia. 
 The post holder will be responsible for the analysis of clinical trial data on the prevalence and intensity of infection at various rounds of mass drug administration in replicated village settings and the estimation of key transmission parameters using various methods including MCMC approaches. Fitting spatially structured individual based stochastic simulation mathematical modelling to data collected in the field trials is a key part of the research in assessing the impact of mass drug administration and the optimal clinical trial design of interventions to control helminth infections in areas of endemic infection by targeting either those most heavily infected, the whole population or segments of it such as school children. The post holder will join a team of epidemiologist at Imperial College London in the LCNTDR in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology. Training in epidemiology will be given – the key qualification for the post is a strong background in statistics. 
 The role requires that you have a MSc in: Statistics or applied mathematics. A strong statistical and computational background is essential – training can be given in infectious disease epidemiology. You will have research experience of statistical analysis and working knowledge of statistical methods relevant to the project. 
 The post is full time for a fixed-term until 30 March 2019.

 The project:  
 Interested in autonomous robots?  Read on...  We're working with Thales, a major international company interested in autonomous systems across a range of applications: planes, submarines, air traffic, train signals, traffic - you name it.  Together, we've identified a problem: the language to express what you want from your system.  Specifications are inflexible; programming languages tell you exactly what to do and when; logic languages see the world in black and white.  We need to work in a much more flexible way: hey robot, here are your goals, here's how you work (usually), now figure out what to do.  Natural language can express all sorts of subtlety and flexibility, but we think it's too big a job for now to teach a plane to understand English.  Instead we want to define a precise semantic language for pretty vague statements like: ""Push button X and Y normally happens."" ""We'd rather you didn't crash than got to your destination."" ""We recommend you do Z if W happens"" ""Tell me if you see anything unusual"".  Then we want to develop software to convert that language into robust decision-making and planning engines.  The PhD will be jointly supervised by Arthur Richards and Jonathan Lawry, both from University of Bristol, and part of the Bristol Robotics Lab collaboration.  It'll be based in BRL's FARSCOPE CDT in Robotics, so you'll get a year of training to begin, be part of a team all learning together, and benefit from extra training and engagement opportunities throughout.  You'll need a range of skills like programming, logic, formal mathematics, control, optimization, planning, hard work and curiosity.  
 You may also be required to spend time at Thales on an industrial placement.

 The role of the Development and Alumni Office (DAO) within SALS is to strengthen links with former students and to fundraise for key university projects. In 2008/09, a new team was appointed to the Development and Alumni Office (DAO). Since then many significant milestones have been achieved in both fundraising and alumni relations and the DAO is now considered a strategically vital part of Goldsmiths.  
 There has been consistent and significant growth in the role of alumni relations at Goldsmiths in the last three years. As well as core alumni relations work - such as events, database, and communications - alumni relations is becoming critical in supporting activities within marketing, recruitment and careers support for students at Goldsmiths.  
 Demand for assistance with alumni relations from across the College is also increasing significantly. Activities include keeping in touch with graduates, tracking graduate career destinations, producing graduate profiles and alumni participation in recruitment. In particular, there is a greater focus on International/EU alumni with a series of overseas alumni events piloted in 2014 and the launch of a new Alumni Ambassador Programme.

 The University of Strathclyde in Glasgow possesses a large internationally rated Engineering Faculty with a proud history of successful joint ventures with industrial and enterprise partners. The Advanced Forming Research Centre (AFRC), based at Inchinnan near Glasgow’s International Airport, has now been operational for six years during which time Industrial, Academic and Government partners have worked together to establish a world leading research facility for the shaping of materials. The centre works closely with major industrial companies including Rolls-Royce and Boeing, and since 2011 it has been a part of the UK High Value Manufacturing (HVM) Catapult. Since its launch the AFRC has achieved a rate of growth and industrial engagement which has surpassed expectations. In the coming years, as well as consolidating its primary strength in forming and forging technology, the centre will develop its ability to support businesses wishing to innovate and will act as a focal point for high value manufacturing in Scotland. 
 This renewed focus and the level of success enjoyed by the AFRC to date have meant that, despite having completed a phase 2 expansion in 2013/14, the AFRC’s current building and infrastructure will need to be expanded to meet future requirements. In phase 3 the AFRC will diversify to some extent from its current core capability of forming and forging, with the new facility being more generally focused on HVM for Scotland. The successful applicant will be responsible for managing the full end-to-end process of delivering phase 3 of the AFRC model, from concept development, and securing of funds, through to opening of the completed facility and have a leading role in the strategic development plans for AFRC HVM for Scotland on an ongoing basis thereafter. This will include liaison with a wide variety of stakeholders in government, local industry, the HVM Catapult, and the University of Strathclyde. 
 The post holder is expected to have a good degree in a relevant subject with significant experience in a related role. The post holder will have the ability to work autonomously, plan and prioritise their own workload, with minimal input from senior management and be able to deal with complex problems presented to them by colleagues. The post holder will also need significant experience of project planning and delivery, as well as excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with a proven ability to interact with and influence a range of stakeholders from industry and academia. 
 Initial interviews have been scheduled for 22/12/2015.

 The studentship is part of the EPSRC Centre of Doctoral Training in Metamaterials (XM 2 ),  www.exeter.ac.uk/metamaterials . Our aim is to undertake world-leading research, while training scientists and engineers with the relevant research skills and knowledge, and professional attributes for industry and academia. 
 Supervisors:  Prof  J R Sambles ,  Prof A P Hibbins ,  Dr R C Mitchell-Thomas 
 This PhD project is part of a 5-year EPSRC Grand Engineering Challenge project, “SYnthesizing 3D METAmaterials for RF, Microwave and THz Applications”, which began in March 2016.  SYMETA's grand vision is to deliver a palette of novel, multi-functional 3D metamaterials using emerging additive manufacturing (AM), with the potential to support a single 'design-build' process. Exeter’s role in this project is to bring expertise/facilities for designing, modelling and characterising novel meta-atoms for operation across the RF and mm wave regime. An example of our previous work in this area can be found in Parke et al., Applied Physics Letters 106, 101908 (2015). 
 The development of meta-atoms through modelling and experimental characterisation is the primary objective of this studentship. It will establish the underpinning principles that govern meta-atom metamaterial components. We will first design a series of meta-atoms, and model their EM response in arrays. Then, we will fabricate and experimentally characterise the EM behaviour of small test-samples. These materials will be designed to possess extraordinary electromagnetic properties, for example near-zero index regions, impedance matched regions, extreme anisotropy and spatially graded parameters. Successful meta-atom designs will be passed to other consortium members for manufacture using AM techniques. 
 The PGR working on this studentship will be required to travel to partner institutions to discuss and monitor fabrication processes and progress.  He/she will also work closely with the Research Fellow (5 year) funded by this project. 
 4-year studentship: for UK/EU students, the studentship includes tuition fees and an annual stipend equivalent to current Research Council rates; for international students (non-EU) a very small number of fees only studentships may be available

 The project:  
 The major source of N-fertiliser for agriculture is the Haber-Bosch process, which chemically fixes atmospheric N 2  into ammonium, ammonium nitrate and urea. The process is highly energy demanding and the over-application of industrial fertilisers results in undesirable greenhouse gas emissions and NO 3 -contamination of drinking water. Natural biological N-fixation via diazatrophic soil microbes constitutes a vital means of N-fertilisation in the absence of industrial fertilisers. However, a better understanding of the quantitative importance of the microbial N 2  fixation capacity of soils is essential to manage agricultural N-fertilisation. 
 This PhD will develop a new approach for determining the importance of N 2 -fixation in soils globally based on  15 N 2  incubations and gas chromatography-combustion-isotope mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) of  15 N-amino acids, biosynthesised during laboratory and field incubations. The approach has been found to be highly effective revealing how different nitrogenous amendments are processed differently by the soil microbial biomass (Charteris et al., 2016). The method is readily adaptable as a novel method to assay N 2 -fiaxtion, with greater sensitivity and specificity compared to existing methods. Once validated, the approach will provide hitherto unobtainable quantitative information on N 2  capture and flow in agricultural and semi-natural soils. 
 Depending on the interests of the student, the effects of different global change variables could also be investigated including warming, elevated atmospheric CO 2  concentrations, or the effects of soil degradation in agricultural systems, with the potential for fieldwork in China.

 Fixed term appointments for up to 3 years starting in January 2017 
 We are seeking to appoint two Research Associates for a project on innovative healthcare engineering jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and EPSRC. The aim of the project is to advance ultrasound imaging technology to improve the detection of birth defects in unborn babies. This will entail the development of a fully automated and computer-guided ultrasound system, allowing midwives to acquire 3D images of the whole baby with much greater detail than is currently possible. A key aspect of the project is the development of intelligent algorithms that will be able to automatically analyse the images acquired. These techniques should substantially improve detection rates of congenital abnormalities. The projects will combine two emerging paradigms in computer and imaging science to address the challenge of identifying fetal abnormalities: Machine learning techniques and very large datasets. 
 To apply you will need to have a strong computing or engineering background. You should have a PhD (or equivalent) in an area pertinent to the subject area, i.e. Computing or Engineering. 
 You should have proven knowledge and track record in several of the following areas: Machine learning, computer vision and medical image analysis (in particular segmentation, registration, feature analysis, modelling or visualization). Preference will be given to applicants with a proven publication track record and excellent programming skills. All applicants must be fluent in spoken and written English. You must have excellent communication skills and be able to organise your work with minimal supervision and prioritise work to meet deadlines. 
 You will be part of the Biomedical Image Analysis Group based at the South Kensington campus. The mission of the group is to develop novel, computational techniques for the analysis of biomedical images. For further information on the group see:  http://biomedic.doc.ic.ac.uk/ . The Group is part of the Department of Computing which is a leading department of Computer Science among UK Universities.

   Applications are sought for a Postdoctoral Research Assistant – Clearance of senescent cells in 2D and 3D human models of ageing. 
 There is now compelling evidence that senescent cells accumulate as we age and may contribute to a plethora of ageing-associated diseases. Clearance of senescent cells prevents or ameliorates a multitude of age-associated phenotypes and as a result targeted depletion of the senescent pool is an attractive strategy for preventing age-related diseases. 
 Using RNAi screening, we have identified a panel of genes whose knockdown selectively kills senescent cells. This project seeks to uncover new routes to reduce the senescent cell burden by gene modulation and to identify new small molecule ‘senolytics’ for the targeted killing of senescent cells. We aim to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the fundamentals of senescence, and to the wider goal of promoting healthy ageing. 
 A background in senescence together with high-throughput cell culture is highly desirable, as is experience in high content image analysis. Training in 3D organotypic models can be provided, and the high-throughput compound screening assays will be performed in collaboration with our Screening Facility. 
 This project is in partnership with Unilever R&D and builds on an existing collaboration. We believe we are poised to make significant contributions to this exciting and emerging field, and are therefore seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic post-doctoral scientist with an interest in senescence and ageing to join our team.

 Further Information: 
 Program tuning combines data from actual program execution with knowledge of the operational behaviour and cost of languages and libraries to derive hypotheses about changes leading to performance improvements. Runtime logs typically capture low-level program events, and reconstructing an account of program execution on the basis of log data can be challenging, particularly for Haskell where programs execute under normal order evaluation rules. A recent PhD (by Peter Wortmann, 2014) made significant progress on the single-threaded case, but there is still a significant gap between our ability to write parallel/concurrent code in Haskell and to interpret its runtime performance. In particular, performance analysis and diagnosis may involve multiple abstraction levels, for example: low-level primitives for parallelism and evaluation control, libraries built on top of those primitives (e.g. the Par Monad, Skeletons, or LVish), and applications that use those libraries. Tools for making sense of runtime data should support the programmer in viewing and thinking about the data at different abstraction levels, and we therefore require new ways of finding patterns within low-level events, possibly by augmenting use of event logs with further information from the program.   Skills needed for the project include good Haskell programming skills, and ideally also confidence with 'C' for working with the Haskell runtime system. I expect the PhD will build on existing work on Haskell runtime visualization which uses Haskell bindings to the GTK2 and Cairo libraries, although a completely fresh approach to the implementation is also possible.

 Dance digitisation takes on new meaning in light of 21st century development of digital and networked media combined with important changes in contemporary dance practice. These changes in dance are evidenced by the growing commitment of dance artists to the development of self-determined discourse, opening up new channels of communication about and through their work. Some of these artists have been experimenting with the possibilities of digital technologies to record, process and transmit their knowledge to others resulting in the creation of interactive installations, DVDs/ book combinations and on line digital archives and education platforms. This project will examine these developments and has the following overarching questions: 
 What influence has the digitisation of movement practices, and the data that emerges, had generally on the Movement and Computing field and specifically the area of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
 In what ways have movement/data researchers drawn on different expert practices and theoretical frameworks to support the digitisation of movement practices and what are the outcomes of these connections? 
 What kinds of tools and technological processes participate in the digitisation of dance and movement practices and how could these be developed to further push the potential of a movement/data/technology nexus? 
 What new insights to dance and movement systems have emerged through the digitisation process? What is the potential of 3D Immersive VR for research into dance digitisation? 
 How has movement knowledge and theories of embodiment expanded and/or changed through digitisation processes? 
 How does the digitisation of dance and the data that has emerged through digital processes influenced or changed the work of digital artists and HCI researchers?

 Project Detail: 
 The proposed project lies in the areas of combinatorics on words and string algorithms with focus on approximate measures. That is to say, we plan to investigate both mathematical properties of approximate versions of strings (e.g., partial words, weighted sequences), as well as investigate algorithmical problems in an approximate setting (e.g., parametrised, probabilistic, approximate algorithms). 
 The aim of the project is to identify problems that are difficult to solve at this point in the context of Big Data and the Internet of Things, and provide faster or more space efficient solutions that deal with an approximation of these, while maintaining a very high accuracy.

 Applications are invited to undertake a 3 year PhD programme in partnership with industry to address key challenges in manufacturing engineering. The successful candidate will be based at the Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre (UTC) in Manufacturing and On-Wing Technology at The University of Nottingham. As an academic institution with one of the best facilities and over 10 years expertise in waterjet machining, the UTC offers a world-class environment for the realisation of high impact research projects in this field. 
 We are seeking applicants for an anticipated September 2017 start, or earlier (depending on the candidate availability, on a project with Rolls-Royce plc. The Rolls-Royce funded Studentship is the result of the expanding waterjet machining activities sponsored at the Rolls-Royce UTC dealing with in-depth investigations of waterjet mill complex geometry aeroengine components made of materials with different mechanical/structural characteristics. 
 The project will deal with the further development of the existing models that University of Nottingham developed to control the material erosion in waterjet machining to enable surface enhancement/preparation of aeroengine components that are made of “sandwich” materials. Apart from aspects in analytical modelling, this will involve using a wide range of sophisticated testing and analysis techniques including Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) for residual stress measurements as well as with development of innovative paths of the waterjet plume so that surface quality complies with Rolls-Royce standards. 
 This project will involve analytical modelling, macro/micro waterjet machining trials, workpiece surface quality analysis (e.g. metallurgy, integrity, residual stresses), followed by investigations on innovative jet path planning to ensure controlled depth (milling) of complex geometries parts made of stratified materials. 
 For mutual interest the project can be offered as a ""package"" - this will include: 
 Appropriate training within Rolls-Royce for a period to be agreed. The training will enable the understanding of the technical issues related to the project, as well as developing a good partnership with the appropriate technical teams. 
 Joint academic and industrial supervision. In this way, the student will develop both academic and industrial skills with multiple career opportunities at the end of the PhD study. 
 For PhD students wishing to pursue an academic career, the opportunity to participate in teaching activities will be sought. 
 The bursary covers the tuition fees and provides a tax-free stipend of approximately £14,296 per year for the duration of the project (three years). 
 This is an excellent opportunity for an enthusiastic first or upper second class graduate in mechanical/manufacturing/materials science/physics to build strong knowledge in both manufacturing and material science while building strong relationships with both academic and industrial areas at international level. 
 Graduates finishing their degrees in June 2017 are also encouraged to apply. Due to the nature of funding only UK/EU applicants can be considered for this position.

 You are invited to apply for a fully-funded three-year PhD studentship, commencing after March 2017, supported by Raytheon UK. The scholarship covers fees for students from the UK or the EU, and provides an annual tax-free stipend of £14,296 (which will increment yearly). 
 The research will focus on investigating Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures in order to develop novel operational assurance techniques for such environments. 
 CPS and IoT infrastructures are increasingly being used within home as well as professional environments. For instance, they are being deployed as part of home automation systems as well as industrial control systems. Their computational capabilities often allow varied and complex processing, and also make them suitable targets for Cyber attacks. A prominent example of this was the Cyber Attack on October 21 st  that affected more than 80 major Internet sites in the US. The attack was blamed on the Mirai botnet which largely targeted unprotected IoT devices, including internet-ready cameras. More than 500,000 devices made up the botnet. Such devices are an easy target since their security provisions are low. 
 The broad aim of this research project is to investigate the structural weaknesses of IoT infrastructures and gateway devices that allow access and connect CPS and IoT infrastructures with the outside world. This specifically includes home gateway devices through which the most recent incidents occurred. In this context the research will also deal with vulnerability discovery and intrusion analysis techniques and the active mitigation of threats. This should also include aspects of real-time situational awareness in order to allow better and faster attribution of causes and incidence handling. You should expect to present aspects of your research at Raytheon organised internal and external events. 
 You will work with a vibrant research team of academic staff, post-doctoral researchers and PhD students across Lancaster University’s School of Computing and Communications, and as part of Security Lancaster. Your supervision will be undertaken by Dr. Andreas Mauthe. Further, you will be working with Dr. Daniel Prince and colleagues from Raytheon who have interest in this research. 
 You will be based within Security Lancaster, an Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research recognised by the UK government and GCHQ. It is one of the few multi-disciplinary centres to tackle human and technological challenges to cyber security by integrating multiple disciplines, covering physics, computer science and social sciences. Security Lancaster is a hive of research activity with over 20 academic staff and a large portfolio of security related research projects. 
 Applicants should be highly motivated and have a first or upper-second class BSc (or equivalent) in a relevant discipline. International applicants must also have IELTS [International English Language Testing System] score of 7 and above (or equivalent qualification). The work requires good mathematical background and basic understanding of cryptographic concepts. The applicant should have an understanding of or an interest in the design of communication frameworks and protocols.

 Applications are invited for a PhD studentship sponsored by Gridded Ion Engine Standardised Electric Propulsion Platforms or GIESEPP project.  GIESEPP is an EU, Horizon 2020 funded project involving a consortium of the major European Companies involved in the development of gridded ion engines and is led by Airbus-Safran Launchers. 
 Project Description: 
 The project goal is to develop, build and test the first European Plug and Play Gridded Ion Engine Standardised Electric Propulsion Platform (GIESEPP) to operate Airbus DS and QinetiQ Space ion engines. These are the only European ion engines in the 200-700W (LEO) and 5kW (GEO) domains that are space-proven, and the consortium’s intention will be to improve European competiveness in this field by significantly reducing the costs and increasing the GIE systems production capacities. 
 The GIESEPP systems will not be limited to xenon as the propellant because not only is it exceptionally expensive its availability is quite limited; assessments will be performed to ensure functionality with alternative propellants. 
 The work will perform preliminary investigations of the operation of the thrusters using alternative propellants by a combination of analytic modelling and experimental testing. Initially a comprehensive review of the published literature on the usage of alternative propellants, such as other inert gases and iodine in GIEs will be conducted. Based on the latter, a number of candidate propellants will be selected for further investigation. The primary criteria used in the down selection will be key performance parameters ( ie specific impulse, thrust to power ratio, efficiency and eV per ion in the discharge chamber), system considerations including density specific impulse, propellant storage, handling and feed system, propellant cost and potential interactions of the thruster plume with the spacecraft (e.g. back flow of charge exchange ions with subsequent coating on spacecraft surfaces). In particular, operation of hollow cathodes with alternative propellants will be investigated taking into account not only expected performance but also chemical compatibility with the low work function inserts and other cathode construction materials at the very high operational temperatures. Zero and 1-D analytical modelling of the plasma kinetics in the discharge chamber and hollow cathode will be developed. 
 Key facts 
 The studentships will be based in the Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE) Research Group within Electronics and Computer Science (ECS). EEE is a multidisciplinary unit within ECS whose research activities include a wide range of topics spanning engineering, physics and materials science. 
 Entry requirements: first or upper second-class degree or equivalent in Applied Mathematics, Physics, Aerospace or Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis on fluid mechanics and/or plasma physics

 Project: Assessing the UK parliament’s online public engagement activity 
 Awards provide fees and maintenance at standard Research Council Rates (£14,553 in Session 2017/18) for eligible applicants. 
 This studentship is in collaboration with the House of Commons. 
 Discussions of contemporary politics have focussed recently on the so-called “crisis of disengagement” bemoaning the increasing disconnection between the public and holders of political authority. On the other hand, political debate takes place increasingly on the Internet and often within disconnected and polarised “bubbles”, which escalate disagreements and do little to promote constructive discussion and compromise. Both phenomena can challenge established democratic systems and contest traditional representative democracy practices if the public does not feel sufficiently represented by policy makers and if democratic compromises become harder to reach. In response to these transformations policy makers have sought new ways to engage with citizens, increasingly making use of digital technologies. Digital debates involving MPs and citizens prior to parliamentary debates are one example of such attempts developed recently by the UK Parliament. However, how effective are these methods of online public engagement? Do these initiatives bring together citizens from different backgrounds who would otherwise not communicate with each other? How can the citizen input be utilised in a meaningful way to inform policy making? When developing this project together with the House of Commons, these were some of the key questions that officials working in citizen engagement raised in collaborative activities (e.g. meetings) leading to this project proposal. The project will address these questions under one main research question: What makes for effective and meaningful parliamentary online public engagement?  In order to answer this question parliamentary online public engagement practice will be first exploratively evaluated through analyses of the “Big Data” that is generated through specific online public engagement activities. Second, a set of field-experiments will be implemented where different online public engagement practices will be tested. The “Big Data” from these field-experimental approaches will be collected and analysed through a hypotheses-driven approach, testing the effectiveness of specific field-experimental interventions designed and implemented in collaboration with the House of Commons. The goal is to establish effective online public engagement practices and to develop analytical tools that could be implemented in order to help the House of Commons to process and explore citizen input in an effective and meaningful way. The PhD includes three short placements in the House of Commons. Seeing its focus on e-democratic processes and a Big Data research approach, the proposed project lies within the “Communication, New Technologies and Data” interdisciplinary pathway with its focus on “cutting-edge frameworks and methods to understand” social interactions facilitated by digital technologies and on “making sense of and manage increasing volumes of data”.

 Our digital identities will define the interfaces to the future services that we will use for entertainment, wellbeing, government, transport, energy, retail and finance. They will be constructed from our location history, our personal data, and digital records that capture who, and where, we are and the histories of our digital, and increasingly our physical and social, interactions. 
 The Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training in My Life in Data will therefore train a community of PhD students with the interdisciplinary skills to address the challenge of digital identity and personal data for the 21st century. 
 We are recruiting one PhD student to carry out research in partnership with  the National Videogame Arcade, Nottingham with a focus on Exploring personal contributions to the National Videogame Arcade. 
 The National Videogame Arcade is a major collection and museum of video games, based in Nottingham. The nature of video games is that many visitors to the museum may also be able to contribute to its collection, for example memories, software and perhaps even hardware. This PhD will explore how gamers can become involved in contributing to the museum’s collection and how their personal data and recollections can be used to enable deep personal interpretation as part of new kinds of social visiting experience. The PhD will suit an “in the wild” approach in which digital technologies are developed, deployed in the museum and studied in order to explore underlying research challenges. 
 Candidates are expected to have a background in computer science, psychology or graphic design for visualisation. Candidates with backgrounds in other STEM subjects will also be considered, if they can demonstrate capabilities in data analytics. 
 The student will benefit from: 
 A fully-funded four-year PhD programme that integrates a leading-edge research project with research training in interdisciplinary skills. 
 At least one internship with our partner. 
 An enhanced stipend of £16,600 per annum as well as a personal laptop. 
 We have funding for UK/Home, EU and international students. Places are also available for those in receipt of four year independent funding/scholarships. Application forms are downloadable from  http://cdt.horizon.ac.uk/apply/current-opportunities  and should be returned by email with a detailed CV, transcript, references and a statement of research interests to  Emma.Juggins@Nottingham.ac.uk .

 The Departments of Chemical Engineering and Natural Sciences are seeking to appoint a PhD student to conduct research for Eco-Innovation Cheshire and Warrington Industry Collaboration programme. Part funded by ERDF. 
 Background 
 This Ph.D. project, a collaboration between Dr Andrew Fogg and BullionTech, will extend and enhance the recycling of autocatalysts. The current protocol is to extract the precious metals, including platinum, palladium and rhodium, before the remaining ceramic casing is sent to landfill. The ceramic casing, which is predominantly alumina mixed with other ceramic materials, becomes contaminated by precious metals and organic compounds during operation of the autocatalyst rendering it unsuitable for further use in autocatalysts and similar applications. This project addresses these issues by proposing a washing protocol for the ceramic material to remove and recover the metal and organic contaminants before seeking innovative uses of the ceramic material to prevent the need for landfill. The latter will require the use of materials chemistry and processing techniques. One potential application would be to use the cleaned ceramic fibre in the fabrication of blocks for the construction industry. 
 Summary of research tasks and work programme 
 Determine the composition and levels of contamination of the ceramic material 
 Investigation of leaching, digestion and crystallisation techniques to remove, recover and recycle the contaminants and ceramic 
 Refinement of the ceramic material into a form suitable for use in other areas.

 Summary: 
 Applications are invited for a 3 year fixed-term Postdoctoral Research Associate position in the Academic Unit of Radiology, University of Sheffield developing image analysis techniques for application to a variety of neurological disorders. This is one of three new positions that will work within a team of leading imaging scientists, radiologists and their collaborators developing advanced image processing and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. It is expected that there will be some overlap of interests between the posts, providing the successful candidate with the opportunity to collaborate and further broaden their skill base and experience. 
 The post will involve developing and evaluating novel computational MR image analysis methods for application to the range of neurological disorders studied within the Unit. Key applications within the group include the assessment of normal foetal development and foetal brain abnormalities in utero, characterising how these abnormalities manifest through childhood with follow-up imaging, development of methods for quantifying cerebellar abnormalities, imaging of diabetes, epilepsy and cerebral small vessel disease. A wide range of imaging techniques are currently employed to study these diseases, including detailed structural imaging, diffusion imaging, spectroscopy, relaxometry, perfusion imaging (ASL and DSC-MRI) and blood-brain barrier imaging (DCE-MRI). Research will focus on improving the characterisation of brain abnormalities using techniques such as computational modelling, registration, segmentation and machine learning. 
 The post will particularly suit candidates from an engineering, computer science, mathematics, or physics background with a PhD, or previous post-doctoral experience in biomedical image analysis, or a related area. Experience with any of the MR imaging techniques and their analysis would be advantageous, as would some experience of computer programming. The successful candidate will be encouraged to develop their portfolio of research aligned to one or more of the imaging techniques and application areas depending on their own interests and expertise.

 Title: Manufacturing process optimisation for high performance electrical steels for low emission advanced electric drivetrains in automotive applications PhD scholarship on developing advanced models for future energy and power generation technologies 
 A 4 year PhD studentship (EPSRC industrial CASE award, co-funded by Cogent Power a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel UK) which aims to optimise the manufacturing process for high silicon electrical steel hot rolled coils produced by a thick slab route. 
 Silicon (Si) is one of the main alloying elements in steels used to promote magnetic properties in electrical steels. The high Si content and the thin sheets with thicknesses as low as 0.1 mm, provide the highest magnetic quality final products. There are many unknowns about micromechanical properties of high Si content electrical steels. Several challenges are involved in the production of these steels grades as the presence of Si leads to a reduced formability that makes the material prone to unexpected brittle fracture at several stages during the production. 
 This project aims to develop a manufacturing methodology for Cogent Power to convert electrical steels with 3.2% Si content, produced by Tata Steel hot strip rolling mill at Port Talbot, into highest quality electrical steels with a thickness of about 0.1 millimetres. 
 Understanding the mechanical and metallurgical properties at different conditions is the first step to predict their deformation behaviour during a manufacturing process and develop required predictive models. Bespoke experimental setups will be designed to investigate and determine the deformation and damage mechanics/mechanisms involved in the hot and subsequent cold rolling operations of the selected material. Multi-scale mechanical tests will be performed to measure microstructural deformation during hot rolling process. 
 The hot rolling process will be experimentally simulated to get a better insight into micro-mechanism of deformation and microstructural evolution during hot rolling of 3.2% Si electrical steel. Thermo-mechanically coupled Finite Element models will be developed to predict formability and damage initiation/evolution in the selected material for different stage of manufacturing operations to be used in Tata’s Port Talbot site. The developed models will be validated using laboratory rolling experiments at Tata’s facilities within the UK and Europe. 
 Entry requirements: 
 Available to candidates with the equivalent of a first class or upper second class degree in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Technology (Metallurgy) Engineering. Skills in mechanics of materials (design and data analysis in mechanical testing), metallurgy of metallic materials, Finite Element analysis (preferably using ABAQUS package and programming with Fortran/C++) are desirable. Relevant research background in fracture/damage mechanics is favourable. 
 The student should be willing to actively engage with the experimental design and conducting experiments within the university’s laboratories and using Tata Steel facilities. They are expected to present the research outcomes for the industrial/academic audience regularly within the UK and Europe. They will occasionally travel to visit Tata Steel production sites in the UK and Europe.

 Project Detail:  
 Hydrogen (H2) holds the potential to provide a clean, reliable, and affordable energy supply that can enhance the UK’s economy, environment, and security. In the coming decades, the UK will need new energy supplies and an upgraded energy infrastructure to meet growing demands for electric power and transportation fuels. Heating and hot water for UK buildings makes up around 40% of our energy consumption and 20% of our greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve the UK carbon emissions reduction target, one of the feasible technologies to is to decarbonise parts of the existing gas network by converting natural gas into H2. The aim of this project is to develop a novel two-stage low temperature hydrogen combustion strategy of rich and lean hydrogen combustion kinetics, CFD flame simulation, and new engineering design concepts for pollutant emissions-free hydrogen appliances. The project will be consists of four key objectives: 
 experimental investigation of hydrogen rich and lean combustion; 
 detailed rich and lean hydrogen combustion kinetics and combustion temperature and products analysis; 
 CFD analysis on air and fuel mixing, flame propagation and geometry effects; 
 Combustion kinetics enhanced CFD analysis on burner optimization.

 The emergence of organic-inorganic perovskites has opened up new opportunities for photovoltaics and novel fundamental aspects of light-matter interaction. In this PhD project, the student will harvest the potential of this emerging family of materials to explore strong light-matter interaction in quantum cavity electrodynamics, exciton-polariton coupling and single-photon emission. This fundamental knowledge will then serve as a launching pad for pioneering electrically driven perovskite-based light sources with the broad tunability of emission wavelengths in the spectral range from ultra-violet (UV) to near infra-red (IR) -such as perovskite lasers via photonic or polaritonic lasing, and microcavity-enhanced single-photon devices. 
 Optically active organic and inorganic perovskites are materials with composition ABX 3   (A = CH 3 NH 3+ , Cs; B = Pb 2 +   or Sn 2+ ; and X = Cl − , I − , and/or Br −) . They have been shown to exhibit very high power conversion efficiencies, they are low cost, nature-abundant in their raw form, and their fabrication processes are low-temperature and scalable. These unique properties make perovskites uniquely suited for revolutionary photovoltaic and lighting applications. For example, solution-processed colloidal perovskites have been shown to display a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield [1], which is comparable to the values demonstrated with epitaxially grown gain media in extensively used III-V laser diodes. However, the gateway to novel opto-electronic applications would only come from the demonstration of electrically driven lasing which is yet to come. 
 Understanding the strong luminescence emission of perovskite materials will be the essential starting point of this ambitious PhD project. For example, the nature of the room temperature emission of the typical methylammonium lead iodide perovskite remains controversial with possible interpretations pointing to free carrier recombination, direct-indirect transition or excitonic emission. Distinct from the conventional semiconductors, quantum confinement and reduced dielectric screening in atomically thin perovskites (2D or quasi-2D) remarkably enhance quasiparticle interactions where many-body effects become more obvious. The optical transitions may entangle with high-order excitonic quasiparticles such as trions and biexcitons and cause unconventional excitonic emission, which will be studied in this PhD project. The final goal of this project will be to demonstrate an electrically driven hybrid graphene/perovskite laser. To accomplish this ambitious aim, the student will harvest the unique synergy of state-of-the-art techniques and complementary knowledge by Dr Namphung Peimyoo (NP) on atomically thin light emitting diodes [2] and lasers [3] and the novel atomically thin electrically conductive graphene materials known as graphExeter [4] discovered by the team of Prof Craciun and Prof Russo. 
 This project aligns with three themes of the metamaterials CDT: a) Graphene and other 2D Materials, b) Nanomaterials and nanocomposites, and c) Quantum Metamaterials. The student in this project will benefit from the broad range of activities on metamaterials at the Exeter CDT. In particular, the top-notch training offered to CDT students will complement the technical skills acquired in the project and diversify the student’s strengths in view of a career in academia or in the industrial sector.

 Applications are invited for a 4-year ESRC Targeted PhD studentship in the area of Computational Social Science, with a focus on using social media data to map geographical variation in psychological phenomena. The studentship would start in October 2018 at the Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge. The successful candidate will conduct research under the supervision of Dr Jason Rentfrow and also in collaboration with Dr Daniele Quercia in the Social Dynamics Lab at Nokia Bell Labs Cambridge. 
 The proliferation of online social media has produced massive amounts of user-generated data, wherein users post statements or upload photos that contain information about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Much of this data is geo-tagged, which makes it possible to explore how the content varies across regions and cities. Such information can potentially be useful for investigating geographical variation in a range of social and psychological processes. The aim of this project is to bridge theory and methods in the social and computational sciences to evaluate the validity and potential value of social media data for inferring psychological phenomena. To that end, the student will receive training in psychological assessment, computer programming, computational modelling and methods for harvesting data from social media. From this skillset, the student will be able to make use of large-scale survey-based datasets with geographical information and combine them with geo-tagged social media data to begin investigating questions about the psychological characteristics of user-generated online social media content. 
 For the first year, the student will participate in an MPhil in Biological Science (Psychology) and will complete a research project. In subsequent years, the student will commence their PhD research in the area of Computational Social Science.

 This EPSRC iCASE project with the UK National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) aims to understand the thermo-mechanical properties of nuclear graphites at elevated temperatures (up to 850°C) that are relevant to current and future nuclear systems. 
 The experimental studies will investigate the relationships between applied total strains (tensile and compressive, measured by image correlation in 2-D and 3-D) and the elastic strains in the graphite crystals (measured, for instance, by synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction). 
 The local effects on microstructure and its properties will be examined by correlative Focussed-Ion Beam (FIB) tomography, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and micromechanical testing at ambient and elevated temperatures. These studies aim to understand how tensile and compressive deformations are accommodated by competing mechanisms such as micro cracking, basal slip and twinning, and what effects this may have on the coefficient of thermal expansion. 
 These data will provide inputs for non-linear finite element modelling of the behaviour of graphites at elevated temperatures. The objective is to validate micro-mechanistic models for graphite deformation, and to provide the foundations for future work on irradiated graphites. During the secondment with the sponsor, the student will engage with NNL's work on modelling and property measurement of irradiated graphites. 
 Candidates are considered in the January 2018 admissions cycle which has an application deadline of 19 January 2018. 
 This is a 4-year EPSRC Industrial CASE studentship in conjunction with NNL and will provide full fees and maintenance for a student who has home fee status (this includes an EU student who has spent the previous three years (or more) in the UK undertaking undergraduate study). The stipend will be at least £16,553 per year. Other EU students should read the guidance at  http://www.materials.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate/eu.html  for further information about eligibility. 
 Any questions concerning the project can be addressed to Professor James Marrow ( james.marrow@materials.ox.ac.uk ).

 Project Detail: 
 Structural materials used in modern engineering applications are more than ever today subjected to extreme loading and environmental conditions. The development of large strains either during manufacturing or in operational conditions often leads to non-trivial deformation modes, such as localisations and microfractures, which are precursors to catastrophic failure. Besides geometrical factors, these events have their roots to the material microstructure. The accurate description and modelling of the mechanical behaviour in these settings is still a challenge for the understanding of materials’ failure and the design of structural components that operate under extreme conditions. 
 The proposed research project aims at investigating the role of microstructure in the development of localised deformation modes in a class of lightweight metal alloys. The workplan consists of experimentation using state-of-the art monitoring techniques (micro-CT, Digital Image Correlation) that intends to quantify specific microstructural features that drive deformation at the microscale. In parallel, numerical codes at the crystalline level will be developed to incorporate the experimental information and predict the mechanical behaviour under different loading scenarios.

 Here’s an exciting opportunity to join an Internal Audit team that is part of a world-class institution based in Birmingham and spreading its influencing across the world. 
 The University of Birmingham is a thriving and dynamic organisation, acknowledged as one of the world’s top 100 universities. Established in 1900 we have a rich history of teaching and research, and a strong reputation locally, nationally and internationally. We continue to grow, invest and develop to achieve our vision of “making important things happen”. The University is in the midst of a transformational campus redevelopment with projects of over £600m creating outstanding new facilities for our students, staff and the local community. As a member of the elite Russell Group of UK universities, we are the first to open a campus in the international education hub of Dubai. We are investing in our IT systems to deliver top-end functionality, slick processes and clear reporting. 
 We build from a strong base. Our teaching was given the highest “Gold” rating in the 2016/17 Teaching Excellence Framework. We have cutting-edge partnerships with blue chip companies and leading universities across the globe. The Barber Institute of Fine Arts houses over 150 pieces from artists including Monet, Turner and Van Gogh. We established a secondary school to enhance the educational opportunities for a diverse range of students. 
 We are looking for an engaged, empathetic, pragmatic Senior Internal Auditor to join our team. You’ll know the basics of internal auditing, but be able to demonstrate advanced skills in delivering it. You won’t be a “tick-box” auditor; you’ll be able to develop relationships up and across the organisation, understand the environment we operate in and our objectives, positively challenge senior stakeholders, be brave enough to ask “are we doing too much?” and get to the heart of the issues we face. Our audit plans are wide and varied, from Home Office visa compliance to project management to financial controls to radiation safety systems to IT applications. You’ll get the support you need, but you’ll be confident in your ability to pick up new areas.

 The project:  Experimental and computational studies of Si and Ge layers on diamond for enhanced NEA and solar power applications - 4 year PhD, as part of the Diamond Science and Technology CDT (1 year at Warwick, 3 years at Bristol, start Oct 2018) 
 Recent experimental and theoretical work has shown that diamond terminated with suitable metal-oxides can have negative electron affinity (NEA) values that are significantly higher than those from hydrogen, and that these surfaces can be stable up to 1000 K. Such surface terminations include LiO, MgO, TiO, AlO, VO, and a range of others yet to be tested. Diamond with a suitable surface termination therefore is an excellent candidate for use in thermionic heat converters for use in solar power generators. 
 Recent reports suggest that sub-monolayers of Si or Ge on diamond may also improve the NEA significantly, whilst remaining air and temperature stable. This PhD is 50% experimental, 50% theoretical modelling. Experimentally, the student will use the new nanoESCA facility at Bristol, equipped with an evaporation/deposition chamber, to deposit sub-monolayers of first, Si and later, Ge, onto single-crystal diamond surfaces. The effectiveness of these surfaces as electron emission sources will then be tested both in situ in the nanoESCA facility (without breaking vacuum), and also in a bespoke thermionic test rig. The experimental work will be guided by theoretical modelling and by surface analysis such as SIMS or XPS. The modelling at Bristol will be performed by bespoke computer packages (CASTEP and CRYSTAL) which have been extensively used by the theory group at Bristol for the past decade to model diamond surfaces. For the computational side, the aims would be to simulate addition of Si or Ge atoms to a (100) diamond surface, varying the coverage from sub-monolayers to 1 ML, and by minimising the energy, predict the optimal geometries for the adsorbed species, their thermal stability, and investigate the factors that determine the resulting electron affinity.

 Project Title: 
 A 4 year joint Masters and PhD research studentship ‘ Feature learning for large multi-category sparse datasets’  with the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, co-funded by Sainsbury’s Bank. Jointly supervised by Dr. Amos Storkey, Dr. Nigel Goddard and a member of the Sainsbury’s Bank data science team. 
 Project Description: 
 In machine learning and computer vision, the standard process of learning to classify, detect and predict involved hand engineering salient features for data or images, and then using those features in standard machine learning algorithms for detection, prediction and calculation of risk. A large industry was built up around developing better hand coded features. 
 More recently, deep convolutional neural network approaches have subsumed this effort: feature learning for images is now an automatic process of the full pipeline optimization methods that are used. Equivalent methods are appropriate on images, game boards, spatial data, sequence data etc., and these are the data domains that have seen substantial application of deep learning methods. However there has been a notable absence of deep learning applications in the broader data domain. Real consumer datasets have features that are quite different from images: fields with very different meanings, highly sparse data, contingent data (A can only happen if B does), relational structure and much higher noise/variation. 
 Application of modern automatic feature learning for these domains is in its infancy but is of critical importance in most application areas. In particular it is vital in the future development for method on customer data. 
 This project will focus on automatic feature determination for data domains with large multi-category sparse datasets. Because such data is not amenable to convolutional methods, a different structural approach needs to be taken. We propose a number of partitioning mechanisms for breaking down and learning appropriate structural decompositions of such data to learn features that are most predictive of a task. 
 Overall the focus of the project is on extending current feature detection methods to data types that are useful for customer data. 
 Project Background: 
 Sainsbury’s Bank builds and maintains a suite of Machine Learning models, which predict key customer behaviours which are linked to business performance. For example a model which predicts the likelihood of a supermarket customer to apply for a credit card. Machine learning approaches expect data to be pre-processed in numerous ways to ensure the efficacy of the resultant model. Of particular interest is the process of transforming atomic data (i.e. supermarket basket data) to a suite of potentially predictive customer-level variables. 
 Deadline: 
 Friday 23 March 2018 at 5pm (GMT) 
 Candidate Profile: 
 We seek applicants with a strong mathematical and programming background; research interests in development and application of machine learning methods real-world problems; and who have the drive and ambition to become a future leader in this exciting area.  Studentship suitable for EU/UK students only.

 This project aims to develop wearable chemical sensors and test the sensors in critical care situations, for the monitoring of biomarkers such as glucose and lactate during major traumas. 
 Background: Monitoring of biomarker levels and medical drugs in a high frequency and at real-time is important as these information can indicate the severity of the conditions and be used to guide immediate clinical decisions for treatment. 
 Biomarker levels are typically measured by taking manual blood samples and then transporting to a laboratory for analysis. This is logistically inefficient, costly and critically offline that could miss vital information and miss the optimal treatment time window. A more efficient strategy is to measure and monitor in situ, thus removing all sample transport logistics. Microfluidic technology, in which small volumes of liquid are manipulated in ~100 µm-diameter channels, offers a route to achieve this, as it allows laboratory processes (fluid additions and titrations, mixing, extraction and separation, optical analysis etc.) to be miniaturised into integrated portable devices. 
 Droplet microfluidics, in which aqueous samples are manipulated as discrete droplets dispersed within a stream of oil, has the potential to miniaturise accurate chemical assays into devices having small footprint that can be wearable. While a long-established laboratory technique, droplet microfluidics is only now making its way into the first field-deployable devices initiated from University of Southampton. 
 In this project you will develop field-deployable droplet-based chemical analysers for monitoring biomarker levels in realtime. Firstly you will develop fundamental droplet microfluidic technology, to be able to analyze both lactate and cytokines, collaborating with other research fellows, scientists, PhD students and engineers. You will then implement the technology into field-deployable systems and test them in clinical settings with clinicians and nurses. 
 We are looking for a student with a First or Upper Second (2:1) class undergraduate degree, or equivalent qualification, in engineering (mechanical, electrical or chemical), analytical chemistry, medicine or another closely related subject. The student will be supported by a generous stipend and will have opportunities to undertake field work. 
 One or more of the following qualities are desirable in the candidate: 
 Experience in device design and engineering, including 3D computer aided design (CAD), microfabrication, 3D printing, custom electronics. 
 Experience in analytical chemistry and associated techniques, including absorbance and/or fluorimetric spectroscopy. 
 Be willing to run clinical tests (after training) with clinicians on health volunteers or in emergency situations.

 Applications are invited for the above position to join the Manufacturing Metrology Team, as part of the Institute for Advanced Manufacturing, at the University of Nottingham. The Manufacturing Metrology Team conducts fundamental research to enable the next-generation of offline and online metrology tools for advanced manufacturing methods with focus on precision manufacturing and additive manufacturing. More information can be found on our website ( www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/manufacturing-metrology ) 
 The objective of this position is to develop and verify an instrument that measures surface topography, or changes in surface topography, during a machining process. The proposed instrument could be mounted into a machining or additive manufacturing operation without significantly slowing down the process, therefore, reducing the cost of many advanced products that require engineered surfaces. An electromagnetic wave will be reflected from the surface being measured and the angular scattering distribution (ASD) analysed in the far-field; a model-based machine learning solution then gives information about the surface topography or topographical changes. They key innovations in this research will be that: a) an instrument is designed to detect topographic features that are much larger than the incident wavelength; and b) ASD pattern analysis will not be model-free, but supported by 2D and 3D models of electromagnetic scattering, useful to data-mine the ASDs in the search for useful features to detect topographical changes. Industrial test case examples for machined and additively manufactured surfaces will be used to illustrate the measurements and analysis process. Whilst the majority of the theoretical modelling of the scattering will be conducted by partners at Loughborough University, the position requires a sound understanding of theoretical optics, so as to be able to interpret the model results. 
 Candidates must have an excellent degree in, preferably Physics or equivalent, and a PhD. Strong skills in optics and computational methods are essential, and specific experience with machine learning is highly desirable. It is also expected that the candidate will demonstrate high level communication and organisational skills and an aptitude for liaison with industrial partners. 
 This full time, fixed term post is available from 1 August 2018 and will be offered on a fixed term contract for 3 years.

 Applications are invited for the post of Postdoctoral Research Scientist in Dr Nicola Smart’s research group on a project focusing on enhancing myocardial and coronary vascular regeneration, based upon understanding and enhancing endogenous responses and by stimulating reactivation of developmental mechanisms. Nicola’s recent research has demonstrated contributions from two specific developmental sources after myocardial infarction (MI): the ventricular endocardium and the coronary sinus (the adult derivative of the sinus venosus). We found that the quiescent epicardium is reactivated and, while direct cellular contribution to new vessels is minimal, it supports the directional expansion of the neovessel network towards the infarcted myocardium. 
 The successful applicant will be responsible for the management of the project by coordinating multiple strands of work to meet deadlines. They will be required to perform myocardial infarction surgery and analyse endogenous neovascular responses over a time course. They will analyse expression of well-characterised enhancer reporter lines post-MI and isolate endocardial and coronary endothelial cells and perform RNAseq The post-holder will contribute ideas for new research projects and for generating research income. They will also be required to act as a source of information and advice to other members of the group on scientific protocols and experimental techniques. 
 We are seeking someone with expertise in basic molecular biology techniques, ideally including platforms such as Next Generation Sequencing (eg. RNAseq studies); microscopy/imaging and genetic manipulation. They should have in vitro experience in cell culture and experience or interest in growing and maintaining human induced pluripotent stem cells and human primary cells from biopsies.

 Salary:

 Applications are invited for  two  three-year Early Stage Researcher pre-doctoral positions in the processing and development of speech technology for pathological speech. The positions are part of the new H2020 Marie-Curie Network TAPAS ( www.tapas-etn-eu.org ). TAPAS brings together a network of Universities, clinical partners and industrial partners to address the communication problems faced by the increasing number of people across Europe living with debilitating speech pathologies (e.g., due to stroke, Alzeheimer’s, Parkinson's, etc). 
 The two projects allocated to the University of Sheffield are: 
 (i) Phrase-based speech recognition for people with moderate to severe dysarthria; 
 The objective is to explore methods for handling larger-vocabulary, phrase-based speech recognition of dysarthric speech including different input strategies, better acoustic modelling, better data capture approaches and better machine learning for an inherently sparse data domain. In particular we will be looking at articulatory representation and deep learning techniques for acoustic to articulatory inversion, 
 (ii) Using Speech Analysis to Detect Onset and Monitor Cognitive Decline. 
 Develop speech technology that can detect, as early as possible, the onset of cognitive decline which might lead to dementia. This must be done in an unobtrusive manner. If a decline in cognitive ability is detected the solution will then monitor the progression and predict future cognitive ability. This project will contribute to the state-of-the-art by investigating ways of monitoring and tracking signs of cognitive decline that work on incidental speech as it occurs in people’s homes. This differs from most current research approaches that tend to focus on planned recordings such as timed naming or picture description tasks. 
 The work in both projects will focus on statistical and machine learning techniques to address the problems, but it will also involve aspects of human understanding, based on a strong interaction with academic, clinical and end-user partners in the TAPAS network. The research will be conducted as part of the Speech and Hearing research group in Sheffield, with opportunities for collaborative work with several of the leading universities and industrial partners in TAPAS, and with the expectation of a 3+ month secondments to 2-3 partners in this project based on their topic of research. Further information about the research group can be found at  spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk 
 The successful individual will be employed as a salaried researcher at the University of Sheffield, while studying towards his/her PhD. Salary rates and additional mobility, career and travel allowances are as per the Marie Curie programme (see Annex 3 of this document  ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/download?docId=31562 , page 69).

 Professor Madhavi Krishnan's laboratory is looking for talented and highly motivated postdoctoral research associates with a strong background in computational fluid mechanics or related areas, to join them in taking forward an exciting emerging area of single molecule measurement. In this specific project we are looking for a candidate with expertise in numerical computations o electrohydrodynamic phenomena to complement our experimental investigations in the field. 
 The group works in the broad area of soft condensed matter at the nanometer scale and has a specific interest in measuring and understanding electrostatics in molecular-scale matter, e.g., biological macromolecules. Using the repulsive electrostatic interaction in solution, the group recently demonstrated the ability to spatially trap single molecules in solution without the use of external forces (Nature, 2010; Nature Nanotechnology, 2012; Nature Nanotechnology, 2017). This “field-free” trap now enables measurements of the physical properties of macromolecules such as their electrical charge, size and 3D conformation with unprecedented precision, one at a time and in real time. The experimental approaches involved centre around optical imaging and spectroscopy and nanofabrication techniques. The work also relies on theory and simulation, specifically focusing on numerical mean-field electrostatics calculations and Brownian Dynamics simulations. 
 The ideal candidate will have obtained a PhD for computational work in fluid mechanics, or a related area, or have submitted a PhD thesis prior to taking up the appointment. Candidates with prior experience in numerical electrohydrodynamics calculations are strongly encouraged to apply. 
 You will be responsible for managing own academic research and administrative activities. This involves small scale project management, to co-ordinate multiple aspects of work to meet deadlines, developing ideas for generating research income, and presenting detailed research proposals to senior researchers etc. 
 Only applications received before 12.00 midday on 31 May 2018 can be considered.

 Overview 
 Hydrogen is predicted to be a major energy vector of the future. Major commercial activities in a range of applications is making this future an inevitability. This PhD will place you at the leading edge of hydrogen production processes of significant promise for large scale hydrogen generation. 
 Current options for hydrogen production also produce greenhouse gases as a byproduct. In this project you will work on chemical looping processes, where such byproducts are inherently separated. Chemical looping processes have seen impressive development across a range of sectors (as well as hydrogen production they are extensively used for carbon capture), and are undoubtedly going to be extensively used in the future energy economy.

 arbnco ( www.arbnco.com ) is a fast-growing company offering a software platform for commercial real estate improvement analysis in support of retrofit strategies to improve operational performance. The platform gives facility managers and others an overview of performance and the ability to drill down to the individual property level. This solution provides users with fully costed investment scenarios for improving energy utilisation and indoor environmental conditions. 
 The Energy Systems Research Unit with the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering is a multi-discipline research group concerned with new approaches to energy utilisation in the built environment and sustainable means of energy supply. ESRU is located within the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and operates the BRE Centre for Energy Utilisation. 
 The University of Strathclyde in partnership with arbnco seeks to recruit a KTP Associate: Building Performance Feedback Engineer to extend the company’s present products by transferring technology for the capture/processing of building performance data in the form of new information services relating to energy use, equipment performance and indoor environmental conditions at frequencies that support effective decision-making. 
 The position forms part of a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) supported by Innovate UK. A KTP is a high profile programme funding excellent projects of collaboration between academia and industry. Graduates are recruited to manage strategic projects within a business, whilst being supported by a dedicated academic supervisor. Founded in 1975, KTP is one of Europe’s largest graduate recruitment programmes (see  www.ktpws.org.uk ). 
 As a KTP Associate you will be an employee of the University of Strathclyde but will spend most of your working time at the company's premises in Glasgow. You will benefit from extensive management training and a generous personal development budget. 
 To be considered for the role you will have a degree at Masters Level (or above) related to energy and buildings and have experience of performance monitoring, data analysis and computational methods. You will also have good knowledge of the construction industry and current expectations relating to low carbon energy systems. You will have excellent verbal and written communications skills with an ability to engage with a variety of stakeholders from academia and industry.
