There are
[three classes](http://www.jobs.ac.uk/recruiters/products-and-prices/)
of jobs to fit every size of pocket (the costs quoted were as on the
23/7/15):

* **standard advert** which allows:
    * 550 words
    * Advertiser's logo
    * Emailed out to a target audicence
    * The cost to a university would be £179
* **standard advert+** has the features of the **standard advert** plus:
    * Branded header image at the top
    * Logo in the search results
    * Cost to a university would be £279
* **enhanced adverts** have all the previous features as well as:
    * Unlimited words
    * Branded and full bespoke design (which kills our ability to parse these)
    * Highlighted blue box in the search results
    * Free further particulars and additional logos
    * Supports video content
    * The price to a university would be £379

Both the **standard advert** and the **standard advert+** are
downloaded and processed.  The **enhanced adverts** are downloaded but
not processed as the internal structure does not appear to be
uniform. Currently the data from **enhanced adverts** is not included.
They also publish some stats on the [job seekers](http://www.jobs.ac.uk/recruiters/why-jobsacuk/demographics/)
that apply for jobs.

A typical job consists of the following structures:

![](imgs/job.png)

Each job has a unique 6 character identifier consisting of capital
letters and numbers.  The components that are currently being picked
up are:

* **Job Name** (maybe this should be called title). This comprises of the first 
  html h1 header.
* **Job Metadata** as this is in a table with a ***table.advert-details***
  css class, which we can pull out individual pieces of job information.
  These comprise of:
     * **Location** - the Location pulled from the job. Format for this
       is not uniform. Also when a list of locations is provided these are
       not separated into the distinct locations but are treated as a
       single location entity in itself.
     * **Salary** - the salary field
     * **Hours** - contracted hours as specified in the job ad.
     * **Contract** - whether the job is offered: 
         * ***Contract/Tempory***
         * ***Permanent***
         * ***Unspecified***.
     * **Contract Type** - information about the contract.
     * **Placed on** - the date of when the job was added.
     * **Closes** - the date of when the job closes.
     * **Job Ref** or **Reference ** - the job reference as provided by the
	 job supplier.
* **Job Description** - the main description for the job. This is
  the main body of the text that gives a description of the job.
* **Additional Job Metadata**
      * **Type/Role** - Type of role as defined in the job ad.
      * **Subject Area** - Semicolon delimited list of subject areas
	    as specified in the job ad.
	  * **Location2** - a second geographica classifier as specified in
		the job ad.

In addition the following metadata is derived:

* **Employer** - the employer is identified from the html excerpt - this
 is pulled from an `href` tag which provides a uniform description
 for each institution. 
* **InUK** - determines whether a job is located in the UK - this uses
  a hand-maintained semicolon delimited look-up table in the
  `InUK.txt` file.  If a job Location is located in the UK it is
  specifed by a `1`, otherwise the value is `0`. Sometimes a location
  is composed of a list a comma separated values - in this case the
  location is treated as a single entity and if any of the locations
  contained is in the UK then the entity is classified as being in the
  UK.
* **SoftwareJob** - determines whether a job is a software job or
 not. A job is classifed as a software job if it has any of the
 following terms:
      * `software developer`|`coding`|`coder`|`research software engineer`|
        `software engineer`|`programming`|`programmer`|`Fortran`|`C++`|`Java`|
        `JavaScript`|`Matlab`|`python|perl`
* **SoftTermIn** - indicate whether the software term as described
  above is found in:
* the job name or title in which case it is assigned a `T` or
    * if it is found in the body it is assigned a `B` or 
    * it is found in the job name and and body and is assigned with a `TB` or 
    * nowhere, in which gets a `N`.	
* **SalaryMin** - the minimum salary where it can be identified from
  the Salaray field.
* **SalaryMax** - the maximum saraly where it can be identified from
  the Salaray field.
* **h1** - a list of all the html h1 titles in the file.
* **h2** - a list of all the html h2 titles in the file.
* **h3** - a list of all the html h3 titles in the file.

Also now collect:

* **Contract Type** has been given it's own column.
* **Reference** is now aliased to **Job Ref**.
* **Funding amount** that is being recorded.
* **Funding for** is now aliased to **Salary**.
* **Qualification type** that is being recorded.

As a final note the typical workflow is:

* [getJobs.pl](https://github.com/softwaresaved/jobs-analysis/blob/master/scripts/getJobs.pl)
  is run every week-day morning at 5am. It searches for all jobs on
  the web-site then compares the job ids to those already downloaded
  and then downloads any new ones it does not know about.
* [jobs2csv.pl](https://github.com/softwaresaved/jobs-analysis/blob/master/scripts/jobs2csv.pl)   
is run subsequently extracting the job information into a `jobs.csv`
  file. It also picks up any locations it does not know
  about. Generally the unknown location will be classified and the
  `jobs2csv.pl` script run again to classify the job locations.


## What is a software job?

For the purpose of this study we take a **software job** to be (from Simon):

>
> Any job that requires development of software.
>

## Identifying software jobs

As previously stated a ***software job*** is currently identfied by having one
or more of a case insenstive search of each job of the following terms:

```
        `software developer`|`coding`|`coder`|`research software engineer`|
        `software engineer`|`programming`|`programmer`|`Fortran`|`C++`|`Java`|
        `JavaScript`|`Matlab`|`python|perl`
```

If any such term is found then the job is said to be a ***software job***. Not
a very good way of classifying jobs.
