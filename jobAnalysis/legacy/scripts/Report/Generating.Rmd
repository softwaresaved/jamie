This report is automatically generated - the graphs generated will
correspond to the latest data available. The report is generated using
R markdown. To generate it you have to make sure that you set the
working directory for your system to point to where this file
(`report.Rmd`) is located. You  can get the files from GitHub using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/softwaresaved/jobs-analysis.git
```

Then in Rstudio do `File->New Project`. Pick the `Existing Directory` and
choose the directory that contains the git clone.

It is assumed that you have:

* the right R libraries installed - you will at least need:
    * ***ggplot2*** - this is required for doing plots.
    * ***pander*** - this allows tables to be printed in markdown.
    * ***scales*** - currently using it for the `percent` function.
    * ***rmarkdown*** - R markdown utilities (for processing out of Rstudio).
    * ***ggmap*** - required for doing plots.
  you can do:
```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2","pander","scales","rmarkdown","ggmap","knitr","tm"))
```
  This will install the required packages and any dependencies.
* that you have the corresponding R files (if you pulled this from the
  GitHub then all should be ok)
* you have the `jobs.csv` file with the raw data in `../data/jobs.csv`
  relative to this directory. If you do not have this already you should be 
  able to pick this up from
```bash
https://trac.software.ac.uk/ssi/browser/Policy/SizeOfResearchSoftwareCommunity/JobAdvertsInvestigation/jobs.csv
```
  or if you would rather keep this updated (it changes every working day) then 
  better to check it out from the svn repository:
```bash
svn checkout https://trac.software.ac.uk/svn/Policy/SizeOfResearchSoftwareCommunity/JobAdvertsInvestigation
```
  if you already have it on your system best to put a symbolic link to it or an 
  alias as it is rather large.
  
You will have to edit the argument in the
`setwd` call to point to your local working directory where this file
is contained. 

This document can be rendered directly from
[Rstudio](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) otherwise one can use:

```bash
R -e 'library(rmarkdown); render("Readme.Rmd")'
```

at the command line. Note that results are cached. 

A `process_cache` and `process_files` directory are created in the
directory where this script is run. You may have to remove these
directories if re-running the scripts is not reflecting changes in the
data.
