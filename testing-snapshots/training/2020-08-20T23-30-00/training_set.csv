2015-04-16,This is an awesome job. You will be coding in C++ and Python for a physics simulation engine that was developed at the University of Gotham. This physics simulation is able to identify the trajectory of projectiles. Key properties are that it must be able to run on low computing usage as one of the main applications is in an all-terrain vehicle,Research Software Engineer,1
2017-11-04,Currently the University supercomputer Hex is operated using an endless supply of ants and lever combinations. This is quite unwieldy and we are thinking of moving to a more systematic approach for spell construction. We are thinking of using cards with holes in them to represent instructions for Hexbut maybe there is something more advanced that we could use,Software Architect,1
2019-07-31,We are looking for wellness mentors who will help cheer up people. This is an important role and you will be working directly with Heads of Departments to organise a five year Cheerfulness Plan that will go a long way in improving the moods of academics,Wellness Mentor,0
2016-08-01,We are looking for a library navigator. Our libraries are so large and the knowledge contained in them so great that it bends space and time. The network of spatiotemporally connected libraries is known as L-space. Unfortunately it has hardly been mapped. We are looking for a competent cartographer who can help us describe the network. The ideal candidate would have had experience working with libraries,Librarian,0
2009-03-02,The University of Telluria is looking for terraformer software architects. As we all know the planet has become mostly uninhabitable due to climate change. We are looking for talented individuals to take up the mantle (pun intended) of transforming this into the lush green oasis it once was. You will be assisted by a team of geonauts and multiple drone teams. Much of the work will involve improving current simulations implemented in C++. Knowledge of R Julia Python and Go are also desirable as you have to work with teams from various regions of the planet. This is a competitive position and we look forward to hearing from you,Terraform Software Architect,1
2020-08-05,The University of Antarctica is looking for ecologists who are willing to brave the harsh climete of Antarctica to study the last mostly uninhabited wilderness. The Antarctic offers a variety of wildlife to study ranging from penguins to ice giants. Ice giants were only recently discovered by radiologists at a depth of 1 km in the ice. Raised from their somnolent bliss their society is fascinating to study (from a distance). This is the opportunity of a lifetime and you will be assisted by two research assistants and a pet penguin,Postdoctoral Research Associate,0
